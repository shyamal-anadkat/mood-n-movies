When the perpetrators of the scheme sell their overvalued securities, the price drops immensely and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth much less than what they paid. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name Stratton Oakmont in 1989.', 'After an exposé in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company.

Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech."", 'In 1996, Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship capsizes in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine; Jordan takes this as a sign from God and attempts to become sober from drugs.', 'In 1998, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. After Jordan rapes her, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their daughter and infant son. In a cocaine-fueled rage, Jordan hits Naomi and tries to drive away with his daughter, but crashes his car in the driveway.', 'Later on, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie, warning him.

Despite breaching his deal, Jordan receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in a minimum security prison for his testimony, and is released in 2000 after serving 22 months.

Schindler bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed.

Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. Göth brutalizes his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives.

At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Jewish Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders."", 'As a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture.

Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire"". Schindler is both touched and ashamed, feeling he should have done more. He breaks down in tears and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the Schindlerjuden awaken the next morning, a Soviet soldier announces that they have been liberated. The Jews then walk to a nearby town.', ""An epilogue reveals that Göth was executed via hanging, and Schindler had failed in both business and marriage following the war.

The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced by Doe at gunpoint to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made, bladed strap-on, representing lust.

Doe offers to confess to his crimes, but only on the condition that he escort Somerset and Mills to a secret location where the victims representing envy and wrath are presumably buried, otherwise he will plead insanity. Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees. During the drive, Doe expresses his lack of remorse for his crimes, declaring that his victims deserved to die, and professes himself to be a martyr chosen by a higher power to shock the world out of its state of apathy. Doe also makes cryptic, threatening remarks towards Mills, who maintains his belief that Doe is simply insane.', 'Doe\'s directions lead the detectives to a remote deserted location. Minutes after their arrival, a delivery van approaches. Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset goes to intercept the driver, who says he was instructed to deliver a box to their coordinates. Somerset opens the box and, in a sudden panic, tells Mills to stay back. Doe reveals that he himself represents the sin of envy, as he envied Mills’ life with Tracy, and implies that the box contains Tracy’s decapitated head. He goads Mills, telling him that Tracy begged for her life and the life of her unborn child, and reacts with surprise and delight when he realizes Mills was unaware that Tracy was pregnant. Despite Somerset’s warnings, an enraged Mills fulfills his own role as wrath and shoots Doe fatally and repeatedly, completing Doe’s plan.

She states that she is a former psychiatrist at Ashecliffe who discovered the experiments with psychotropic medication and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop mind control techniques. Before Solando could report her findings to the authorities, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe. She insists that Ashecliffe is attempting to create shells of human beings so psychotic they will be completely comfortable in committing absolutely insane atrocities against society.  When Teddy reveals his past experience with trauma, she insists that the hospital will use Teddy’s experiences to feign a psychotic break, allowing them to also trap him through forced commitment to the hospital. Solando notices Teddy’s injured head, and asks if he’s been having strange dreams or headaches. He confirms that he has, and a suddenly-panicked Solando reveals that it’s likely that Teddy has likely been fed neuroleptic narcotics through the pill he was offered during his migraine, as well as the food, coffee and cigarettes at the facility. She explains that the narcotics manifest firstly as palsy, beginning as a restriction of use in the fingers and hands, which Teddy has begun to experience. Teddy diverts the conversation to the lighthouse, which is apparently where experimental neurosurgeries take place. "", 'Teddy returns to the hospital and is greeted by Dr. Cawley. When Teddy enquires to Cawley about Chuck’s whereabouts, Cawley firmly insists that Teddy does not have a partner, that he arrived on the island alone. Teddy submits, pretending to agree that he has no partner to remove suspicion. ', 'Convinced Chuck was taken to the lighthouse, Teddy steals a set of keys from a guard. He tries to flee to the lighthouse with them, but runs into Dr. Naehring, who attempts to stab him with a sedative-loaded syringe. Teddy overpowers Naehring, stabbing him with the syringe and sedating him. While hiding from staff on his way to the lighthouse, Teddy discovers a car. As his hallucinations worsen, he dips the tie his wife bought him in the cars gas tank, fashioning it as a wick and lighting it up, causing the car to explode into flames and distract the staff. ', 'Teddy breaks into the lighthouse, only to discover Dr. Cawley smugly waiting for him, telling him that his gun isn’t loaded. Teddy shakily confronts Cawley and reveals his encounter with Solando, confirming he knows that Cawley drugged him. Cawley denies that Solando ever existed and insists that Teddy has not been fed narcotics, explaining the tremors as being withdrawals from Chlorpromazine, an anti-psychotic medication that he has been taking for the “last 24 months”. Teddy rejects Cawley’s insistence that he is and has been a patient of the hospital for the last 2 years. Cawley explains that Teddy is actually Andrew Laeddis, Cawley continues confronting Teddy as their ""most dangerous patient"", incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his manic depressive wife, Dolores, after she drowned their three children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are anagrams of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal, and the little girl from Laeddis\'s recurring dreams is his daughter, Rachel. Cawley also discloses that Andrew attacked Noyce two weeks earlier for calling him Laeddis. Teddy\'s denial comes from his guilt over not having sought mental help for his wife after she burned down their city apartment. After the arson, the whole family went to the lake house, where Dolores drowned their children some time later.  According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to cure Andrew\'s conspiracy-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Teddy Daniels. The hospital staff were part of the test, including Lester Sheehan posing as Chuck and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. Andrew\'s migraines were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were his hallucinations of the ""real Rachel Solando"". Overwhelmed by the memories of what really happened, Andrew faints.', ""He awakens in the hospital under the watch of Cawley, Sheehan, the warden and the nurse who played Rachel Solando. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, satisfying the doctors. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but Andrew quickly regressed. He warns this will be Andrew's last chance; otherwise, they will have to lobotomize him."", 'Some time later, Andrew relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan, but calls him ""Chuck"" again, saying they must leave the island. Sheehan shakes his head to Cawley, upon which Cawley speaks to Naehring and the warden before turning away. The warden gestures to the orderlies and Andrew is taken away to be lobotomized. Before leaving peacefully, Andrew asks Sheehan if it would be worse ""to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"" A stunned Sheehan calls Andrew ""Teddy"", but the latter does not respond to the name.']]"

Juror 8 reasons that the witness, who was trying to sleep when she saw the killing, was not wearing her eyeglasses when it happened and she would not have had time to put them on to get a clear view of the person who did the stabbing, making her story dubious.

Using the officer\'s trysts with an underage prostitute as blackmail, the five youngsters start a gang with the same level of police protection as Bugsy. Max and Noodles become best friends.', 'The group rises through the ranks after implementing Noodles\' idea to hide bootleg liquor. They stash half their earnings in a railway station locker, giving the key to ""Fat Moe"", a friend not directly involved in their activities.

That the job had been commissioned by a Syndicate figure to eliminate the competition sits badly with Noodles who, unlike Max, dislikes hierarchy and lacks political ambition. The gang provides protection for Teamsters' union boss Jimmy O'Donnell, but Noodles later rejects Max's plan to deepen those ties."", ""Seeking to form a genuine intimacy with Deborah, Noodles takes her on a lavish date, the tone of which is altered when she reveals her plans to pursue a career in Hollywood.

Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. During their argument near the fountain, Robbie accidentally breaks a vase and yells at Cecilia to stay where she is – so as to avoid cutting her feet on the broken pieces on the ground. Still angered, Cecilia then strips off her outer clothing, stares at him and climbs into the basin to retrieve one of the pieces. Briony misinterprets the scene as Robbie ordering her sister to undress and get in the water."", 'Robbie drafts a note to Cecilia to apologise for the incident. In one draft, designed only as a private joke, he confesses his sexual attraction to her in explicit terms. He then writes a more formal letter and gives it to Briony to deliver. Only afterwards does he realise he has given her the wrong letter. Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her 15-year-old visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a ""sex maniac"". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony\'s older brother, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola. Before dinner, Robbie apologises to Cecilia for the obscene letter but, to his surprise, she confesses her secret love for him. They proceed to make passionate love in the library. Briony walks in on them and thinks that Robbie is raping Cecilia.', ""At dinner, Lola's twin brothers go missing and a search is organised. Outside in the dark, Briony sees Lola apparently being raped by a man, who flees upon being discovered. The two girls talk and Briony becomes convinced that it was Robbie again. A confused Lola does not dissent. Robbie finds the twins and returns with them. On the basis of Lola and Briony's testimony, and the explicit letter Robbie wrote to Cecilia, he is arrested for the rape."", ""Four years later, during the Second World War, Robbie has been released from prison on the condition that he joins the army and fights in the Battle of France. Separated from his unit, he makes his way on foot to Dunkirk. He thinks back to six months earlier when he met Cecilia, now a nurse. Briony, now 18, has chosen to join Cecilia's old nursing unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London rather than go to the University of Cambridge. She writes to her sister, but Cecilia has not forgiven her for her part in the investigation and conviction years before. Robbie, who is falling gravely ill from an infected wound, finally arrives at the beaches of Dunkirk, where he waits to be evacuated."", 'Later, Briony, who now regrets implicating Robbie, learns from a newsreel that Paul Marshall, who now owns a factory supplying rations to the British army, is about to marry Lola. Briony goes to the ceremony and she realises that it was Paul who assaulted Lola. Briony goes to visit Cecilia to apologise directly, and suggests correcting her testimony to which Cecilia says she would be an ""unreliable witness"". Briony is surprised to find Robbie there living with her sister, while in London on leave. Briony apologises for her deceit, but Robbie is enraged that she has still not accepted responsibility for her actions. Cecilia calms him down and then Robbie instructs Briony how to correct the record and get Robbie\'s conviction overturned. Briony agrees. Cecilia adds that Briony include what she remembers of Danny Hardman, but Briony points out that Paul Marshall was the rapist and Cecilia adds he has just married Lola and now Lola will not be able to testify against her husband.', 'Decades later, Briony is an elderly and successful novelist, giving an interview about her latest and last book, an autobiographical novel titled Atonement, as she is dying from vascular dementia. She confesses that the scene in the book describing her visit and apology to Cecilia and Robbie was entirely imaginary. Cecilia and Robbie were never reunited: Robbie died of septicaemia at Dunkirk on the morning of the day he was to be evacuated and Cecilia died months later in the Balham tube station bombing during the Blitz. Briony hopes to give the two, in fiction, the happiness that she robbed them of in real life. The last scene shows an imagined, happily reunited Cecilia and Robbie staying in the house by the sea which they had intended to visit once they were reunited.']]"

While treading water, she is unknowingly attacked by an unseen force. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's conclusion that the death was due to a shark attack leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reverse his decision, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner tentatively concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until the shark kills a young boy, Alex Kintner, in full view of a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy, and local professional shark fisherman Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark—an unusually large one."", ""When local fishermen catch a tiger shark, the mayor proclaims that the beach is safe. Mrs. Kintner, Alex's mother, confronts Brody and blames him for her son's death. Hooper expresses doubts that the tiger shark is responsible for the attacks, and his suspicions are confirmed when no human remains are found inside its stomach after dissection. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper removes a sizable great white shark's tooth from the boat's hull, but drops it in fright after discovering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank with a fake shark, the real shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to hire Quint."", ""Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a chum line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6\xa0m) and weight at 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears."", ""At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the attack on the USS Indianapolis. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he overtaxes the damaged engine and it fails."", ""As the Orca slowly sinks, the trio attempts a riskier approach. Hooper enters the water in a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine, using a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks and is lost. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark breaks free and leaps onto the boat, devouring Quint in the process. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody shoves a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth and climbs onto the crow's nest. He shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, killing the shark with the resulting explosion. Hooper resurfaces and paddles back to Amity Island with Brody, clinging to the remaining barrels.""]]"

Candlemas concurs with Imbolc, one of the Celtic 'cross-quarter days', the four days which marked the midpoints between solstice and equinox.[21][20]"", 'Scholar Rhys Carpenter in 1946 emphasized that the Badger Day tradition was strong in Germany, but absent in the British Isles, and he referred to this as a reason that the U.S. Groundhog Day was not brought by immigrants from these places.[22]', ""There did exist a belief among Roman Catholics in Britain that the hedgehog predicted the length of winter, or so it has been claimed, but without demonstration of its age, in a publication by the Scotland-born American journalist Thomas C. MacMillan in 1886,[19] and American writer/journalist Samuel Adams Drake's book published in 1900.[23][h]"", ""In the Gaelic calendar of Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man, Brigid's Day (February 1) is a day for predicting the weather.[24][25] While in Scotland the animal that heralds spring on this day is a snake,[i] and on the Isle of Man a large bird,[27] in Ireland folklorist Kevin Danaher records lore of hedgehogs being observed for this omen:"", 'The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a Welsh enclave but the diarist was commenting on his neighbors who were of German stock.[j][k][20][28]', 'The first reported news of a Groundhog Day observance was arguably made by the Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1886:[l] ""up to the time of going to press, the beast has not seen its shadow"". However, it was not until the following year in 1887 that the first Groundhog Day considered ""official"" was commemorated there,[29] with a group making a trip to the Gobbler\'s Knob part of town to consult the groundhog. People have gathered annually at the spot for the event ever since.[30][18]', 'Clymer Freas (1867–1942)[m] who was city editor at the Punxsutawney Spirit is credited as the ""father"" who conceived the idea of ""Groundhog Day"".[31][n] It has also been suggested that Punxsutawney was where all the Groundhog Day events originated, from where it spread to other parts of the United States and Canada.[33]', 'The Groundhog Day celebrations of the 1880s were carried out by the Punxsutawney Elks Lodge. The lodge members were the ""genesis"" of the Groundhog Club formed later, which continued the Groundhog Day tradition. But the lodge started out being interested in the groundhog as a game animal for food. It had started to serve groundhog at the lodge, and had been organizing a hunting party on a day each year in late summer.[34]', 'The chronologies given are somewhat inconsistent in the literature. The first ""Groundhog Picnic"" was held in 1887 according to one source,[31] but given as post-circa-1889 by a local historian in a journal. The historian states that around 1889 the meat was served in the lodge\'s banquet, and the organized hunt started after that.[34]', 'Either way, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club was formed in 1899, and continued the hunt and ""Groundhog Feast"", which took place annually in September.[35][36] The ""hunt"" portion of it became increasingly a ritualized formality, because the practical procurement of meat had to occur well ahead of time for marinating. A drink called the ""groundhog punch"" was also served.[o][37][38] The flavor has been described as a ""cross between pork and chicken"".[39] The hunt and feast did not attract enough outside interest, and the practice discontinued.[35]', 'The groundhog was not named Phil until 1961, possibly as an indirect reference to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[40]', 'The largest Groundhog Day celebration is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where crowds as large as 40,000 gather each year[41] (nearly eight times the year-round population of the town).[42] The average draw had been about 2,000 until the 1993 film Groundhog Day, which is set at the festivities in Punxsutawney, after which attendance rose to about 10,000.[35] The official Phil is pretended to be a supercentenarian, having been the same forecasting beast since 1887.[35]', 'In 2019, the 133rd year of the tradition, the groundhog was summoned to come out at 7:25\xa0am on February 2, but did not see its shadow.[43] Fans of Punxsutawney Phil awaited his arrival starting at 6:00\xa0am, thanks to a live stream provided by Visit Pennsylvania. The live stream has been a tradition for the past several years, allowing more people than ever to watch the animal meteorologist.[44]', '2021 was the 135th, and for the first time, much of the Inner Circle members were required to wear a mask. The groundhog was summoned at 7:25\xa0am on February 2 and saw its shadow.[45] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceremony was held behind closed doors, with no fans allowed to attend.', '2022 saw the 136th time of the event and the groundhog saw its shadow, predicting six more weeks of winter.[46]']]"

Benedict studies the video footage and recognizes that the flooring in the vault on the video lacks the Bellagio logo, which had been added only recently to the vault.

Haller orders a lunch recess immediately after Wilbur's testimony. Vinny asks for a full day's continuance to properly prepare for cross-examination, but Haller denies the request. With only the lunch recess to prepare and unable to come up with a strong line of questioning, Vinny lashes out at Lisa, but then realizes that one of her photos holds the key to the case: the flat and even tire marks going over the curb reveal that Bill's car could not have been used for the getaway."", ""After requesting a records search from the local sheriff, Vinny drags an angry Lisa into court to testify as an expert witness, as she comes from a family of auto mechanics and has an encyclopedic knowledge of cars. During Vinny's questioning, Lisa testifies that only a car with an independent rear suspension and positraction could have made the tire marks, which rules out Bill's 1964 Buick Skylark. One model of car with these features is the similar-looking 1963 Pontiac Tempest.   Because both Buick and Pontiac are owned by GM, the Pontiac Tempest was also available in metallic mint-green. Vinny recalls Wilbur, who confirms this information, effectively discrediting his own testimony. He then recalls the local sheriff, who testifies that two men who fit Bill and Stan's descriptions were just arrested in Georgia for driving a stolen metallic mint green Pontiac Tempest, and were in possession of a .357 magnum revolver which was the gun of the same caliber used to kill the clerk. After Vinny rests for the defense, Trotter dismisses all charges. The judge congratulates Vinny and, as they drive away, Vinny and Lisa bicker about their wedding plans.""]]"

As three clairvoyant humans (""Precogs"") visualize an impending homicide, officers analyze the data to determine the crime\'s location and apprehend the perpetrator before the crime occurs. The Precogs lie in a shallow pool, under sleep-inducing drugs that deprive them of external stimulus. Their thoughts are projected onscreen and stored in a database. Would-be killers are imprisoned in a benevolent virtual reality state. Although Precrime has eliminated nearly all premeditated murders during its six-year existence, spontaneous ""crimes of passion"" remain problematic, leaving police limited time to intercept the killer. ', 'While United States Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer audits the Precrime operation, the Precogs predict that in 36 hours, the program\'s commanding officer, John Anderton, will kill Leo Crow, a man Anderton has never met. Anderton joined the Precrime program six years earlier after his young son, Sean, was kidnapped and never found. He is depressed, withdrawn, and addicted to neuroin, a fictional hard drug. His wife, Lara, has since left him. Anderton flees the facility, prompting a manhunt led by Witwer. Anderton tracks down Precrime founder, Dr. Iris Hineman, at her country home and learns that one Precog occasionally sees a different future vision from the other two, a ""minority report"" of a possible alternate timeline. These discrepancies are reviewed and purged from the official record as group precognition agreement is the foundation of the Precrime bylaws. However, a backup copy is retained within the mind of the Precog who generated it. Anderton also discovers that early neuroin adopters and addicts were predisposed to having mentally disabled children, many of which had precognitive abilities. In the testing of the precognitive children, most had passed away except for three who were turned over to Precrime. Anderton returns to Precrime and kidnaps Agatha, described by Hineman as the most clairvoyant Precog, shutting down the group-mind on which Precrime depends. Anderton and Agatha track Crow to a hotel room and find numerous photos of children, including Sean; Anderton accuses Crow of killing Sean, but Crow claims he was hired to plant the photos. He wants Anderton to kill him so that his family will be paid a large sum after his death. When Anderton refuses, Crow kills himself in a similar manner to the Precog file.', ""Anderton fails to find a minority report within Agatha's mind, but discovers a vision of a past murder from five years earlier; the victim was Agatha's mother, Anne Lively, who sold her daughter to Precrime while addicted to neuroin. After breaking her addiction, she tried to reclaim the child, but was drowned by a hooded figure. While investigating Crow's death, Witwer learns that two attempts were made on Lively's life; the first was thwarted by Precrime, but the second one succeeded a few minutes later. Witwer reports his findings to Precrime Director Lamar Burgess, who kills him without being detected since the Precog system is offline."", 'Anderton is eventually captured and imprisoned for murdering Crow and Witwer, and Agatha is reconnected to the system. Burgess inadvertently reveals himself as Lively\'s killer while talking with Lara, who uses the information to force Anderton\'s release from prison. Anderton plays footage of Lively\'s death at a banquet in Burgess\' honor. Knowing that Precrime is unable to function without Agatha, Burgess killed Lively himself in the same manner as the failed attempt on her life, and the technicians regarded the actual murder as an ""echo"" and purged it like other echo premonitions.', ""After Agatha is returned to the system, a new Precrime report is generated, showing that Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess tells Anderton he was set up because he was close to discovering Anne Lively's murder. Anderton points out the dilemma Burgess now faces: kill him and validate Precrime at the cost of his own freedom, or spare him and see the program be discredited and shut down. Anderton points out that Burgess can change his own future since he now knows it. Burgess kills himself.

Galloway encourages Kaffee to call Jessup as a witness, despite the risk of being court-martialed for smearing a high-ranking officer. "", 'Jessup spars with Kaffee\'s questioning, but is unnerved when Kaffee points out a contradiction in his testimony: Jessup stated his Marines never disobey orders and that Santiago was to be transferred for his own safety. Kaffee asks why Santiago was in danger if Jessup ordered his men to leave him alone. Disgusted by what he sees as Kaffee\'s impudence towards the Marines, Jessup extols the military\'s importance, and his own, to national security. Finally, Jessup bellows with contempt that he ordered the ""code red"". Jessup tries to leave the courtroom but is arrested.', 'Dawson and Downey are cleared of the murder and conspiracy charges, but found guilty of ""conduct unbecoming"" and will be dishonorably discharged.  Downey does not understand what they did wrong; Dawson explains that they had failed to defend those too weak to fight for themselves, like Santiago.

As a heterosexual, he initially refuses to accept the diagnosis but remembers having unprotected sex with a prostitute who was an intravenous drug user a couple years prior. He is soon ostracized by family and friends who mistakenly assume he contracted AIDS from homosexual relations. He gets fired from his job, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks, who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half a placebo, as this is the only way they can determine if the drug is working.', 'Woodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him AZT. As soon as he begins taking it, he finds his health deteriorating (exacerbated by his cocaine use). When he returns to the hospital, he meets Rayon, a drug addicted, HIV-positive trans woman, to whom he is initially hostile. As his health worsens, he drives to a makeshift Mexican hospital to get more AZT. The facility is run by a Dr. Vass, who has had his American medical license revoked because aspects of his work with AIDS patients had violated US regulations. Vass tells Woodroof that the AZT is ""poisonous"" and ""kills every cell it comes into contact with"". He instead prescribes a cocktail of drugs and nutritional supplements centered on ddC and the protein peptide T, which are not yet approved in the US. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved. It occurs to him that he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. Since the drugs alone are not illegal, he is able to get them over the border by masquerading as a priest and swearing that they are for personal use. Meanwhile, Saks also begins to notice the negative effects of AZT, but is told by her supervisor, Dr. Sevard, that it cannot be discontinued.', 'Over the next year, Woodroof begins selling the drugs on the street, at gay nightclubs, and at discotheque bars. He comes back into contact with Rayon, with whom he reluctantly sets up business since she can bring in more customers. The pair establish the ""Dallas Buyers Club"", charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. He gradually begins to respect Rayon as a friend. When Woodroof has a heart attack caused by an overdose of recently acquired interferon, Sevard learns of the club and the alternative medication. He is angry that it is interrupting his trial. The FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Saks agrees that there are benefits to AIDS medicine buyers clubs (of which there are several around the country) but feels powerless to change anything. The processes that the FDA uses to research, test and approve drugs are seen as flawed and a part of the problem for AIDS patients. Saks and Woodroof strike up a friendship.', 'The FDA gets a warrant to raid the Buyers Club, but can ultimately do nothing beyond fining Woodroof. In 1987, the FDA changes its regulations, making any unapproved drug illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon has died after being taken to the hospital. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she has been linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug ineffective. She refuses, and insists that she will have to be fired instead.', ""As time passes, Woodroof shows more compassion towards gay, lesbian, and transgender members of the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is the provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in late 1987 he files a lawsuit against the FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is sympathetic toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the power to do anything. As the film ends, the on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of the disease's effects in 1992, 7 years later than his doctors initially predicted.""]]"

A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land in the desert outside Flagstone that contains the region's only other water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain, who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area, to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton—who wants to complete a transcontinental railroad before dying from bone tuberculosis—learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne. Meanwhile, former prostitute Jill arrives at Flagstone from New Orleans, revealing that she was McBain's new wife, and therefore the new owner of the land."", 'The film opens with a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman, whom Cheyenne later dubs ""Harmonica"", shooting three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse near West and East Mitten Buttes on the way to Sweetwater, where he also encounters Mrs. McBain, Harmonica informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne\'s men. Cheyenne arrives at Sweetwater soon after, and both men seem attracted to Mrs. McBain. Harmonica explains that according to the contract of sale, she will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track\'s construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it.', ""Frank turns against Morton, who wants to make a deal with Mrs. McBain, and immobilizes him under guard on his private train out in the desert. Instead, Mrs. McBain allows Frank to seduce her, seemingly to save her life, and is then forced to sell her property in an auction, where Frank's men intimidate the other bidders. Harmonica disrupts Frank's plan to keep the price down when he arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid with the reward money for the wanted Cheyenne, but as Cheyenne is placed on a train bound for the newly opened Yuma prison, two members of his gang purchase one-way tickets for the train, intending to help him escape."", 'Morton now pays Frank\'s men to turn against him. Harmonica helps Frank kill them, though, by directing his attention to their whereabouts from the room where Mrs. McBain is taking a bath. On Frank\'s return to Morton\'s train, he finds that his remaining men have been killed in a battle with Cheyenne\'s gang, and that Morton lies face down in a mud puddle where he leaves him to die. Frank then goes to Sweetwater to confront Harmonica. On two occasions, Frank has asked him who he was, but both times Harmonica only answered with names of men ""who were alive before they knew you"". This time, Harmonica says he will reveal who he was ""only at the point of dying"".', ""As the two prepare for a gun duel, Harmonica's motive is revealed in a flashback. A younger Frank forces a boy to support his older brother on his shoulders, while his brother's neck is in a noose strung from an arch. As the boy struggles to hold his brother's weight, Frank stuffs a harmonica into the panting boy's mouth. The older brother curses Frank, and the boy (who will grow up to be Harmonica) collapses to the ground. Back in the present, Harmonica draws first and shoots Frank. He then stuffs his harmonica into the dying Frank's mouth as a reminder."", ""At the house again, Harmonica and Cheyenne say goodbye to Mrs. McBain, who is supervising the construction of the railway station as the track-laying crews reach Sweetwater. As the two men ride off, Cheyenne falls, revealing he was mortally wounded by Morton during the fight with Frank's gang. While Harmonica rides away with Cheyenne's dead body, the work train arrives and Mrs. McBain carries water to the rail workers.""]]"

Though outnumbered, Ness and Stone manage to capture Payne alive and kill all his escorts without harm to the mother or the child."", ""Later, when Payne testifies at Capone's trial, Ness observes that Capone appears strangely calm and that Nitti is wearing a gun in the courtroom. The bailiff removes Nitti and searches him, finding a note from Chicago Mayor William Hale Thompson which effectively permits him to carry the weapon. However, noticing Malone's address written on a matchbook in Nitti's possession, Ness realizes that Nitti killed Malone. Panicked, Nitti shoots the bailiff before fleeing to the courthouse roof, where Ness captures him. After Nitti insults the memory of Malone and gloats that he will never be convicted for the murder, Ness pushes Nitti off the roof to his death."", 'Stone gives Ness a list, taken from Nitti\'s coat, which shows that the jurors in the trial have been bribed.

On the day Capone begins serving his sentence, Ness closes up his office, giving Malone\'s St. Jude medallion and callbox key to Stone as a farewell present.

As Richard died in 1940, he is not a suspect. Her father, Gottfried, who is described as a heavy drinker, womanizer and wife beater, accidentally drowned in a lake a year prior to Harriet’s disappearance, so he is not a suspect either.

After the latest raid, during which Calvera kills a villager, the village leaders decide they have had enough. On the advice of the village elder, they decide to fight back. Taking their few objects of value, three villagers ride to a town just inside the United States border hoping to barter for weapons. They are impressed by Chris Adams, a veteran Cajun gunslinger, and approach him for advice. Chris suggests they instead hire gunfighters to defend the village, as ""men are cheaper than guns."" At first agreeing only to help them recruit men, Chris eventually decides to lead the group. Despite the meager pay offered, he finds five willing gunmen.', ""They are the gunfighter Vin Tanner, who has gone broke after a round of gambling and resists local efforts to recruit him as a store clerk; Chris's friend Harry Luck, who assumes Chris is hiding a much bigger reward for the work; the Irish Mexican Bernardo O'Reilly, who has fallen on hard times; Britt, an expert in both knife and gun who joins purely for the challenge involved; and the dapper, on-the-run gunman Lee, plagued by nightmares of fallen enemies and haunted that he has lost his nerve for battle. On their way to the village, they are trailed by the hotheaded Chico, an aspiring gunfighter whose previous attempts to join Chris had been spurned. Impressed by his persistence, Chris invites him into the group."", 'Arriving at the village, they work with the villagers to build fortifications and train them to defend themselves. They note the lack of women in the village until Chico stumbles upon Petra and discovers the women were hidden in fear that the gunmen would rape them. The gunmen begin to bond with the villagers, and Petra pursues Chico. When Bernardo points out that the gunmen are being given the choice food, the gunmen share it with the village children.', ""Three of Calvera's men are dispatched to reconnoitre the village; due to a mistake by Chico, the seven are forced to kill all three rather than capture at least one. Some days later Calvera and his bandits arrive in force. The seven and the villagers kill another eight of their cohorts in a shootout and run them out of town. The villagers celebrate, believing Calvera will not return. But Chico infiltrates Calvera's camp and learns that Calvera must return, as his men are short of food."", 'Some fearful villagers thereupon call for the gunfighters to leave. Even some of the seven waver, but Chris insists that they stay, even threatening to kill anyone who suggests giving up the fight. The seven ride out to make a surprise raid on Calvera\'s camp, but find it abandoned. Returning to the village, they are caught by Calvera and his men, who have colluded with some of the villagers to sneak in and take control. Calvera spares the seven\'s lives, believing they have learned the simple farmers are not worth fighting for and fearing reprisals from the gunfighters\' ""friends"" across the border. Preparing to depart, Chris and Vin admit they have become emotionally attached to the village. Bernardo likewise gets angry when the boys he befriended call their parents cowards. Chico declares that he hates the villagers; when Chris points out he grew up as a farmer as well, Chico angrily responds that it is men like Calvera and Chris who made the villagers what they are.', 'The seven gunmen are escorted some distance from the village, where their weapons are returned to them. They debate their next move and all but Harry, who believes the effort will be futile and suicidal, agree to return and fight.', 'The gunmen infiltrate the village and a gunfight breaks out. Harry, who has had a change of heart, returns in time to save Chris\'s life but is himself fatally shot. Harry pleads to know what they were fighting for, and Chris lies about a hidden gold mine to let Harry believe he died for a fortune; Harry smiles before dying. Lee finds the nerve to burst into a house where several villagers are being held, shooting their captors and releasing the prisoners to join the fight, but is gunned down as he leaves the house. Bernardo, shot protecting the boys he befriended, tells them as he dies to see how bravely their fathers fought. Britt dies after shooting at many bandits but exposing himself from cover. Chris shoots Calvera, who asks him, ""You came back... to a place like this? Why? A man like you? Why?"" He dies without receiving an answer. The remaining bandits take flight.', 'The three surviving gunmen ride out of town. As they stop atop a hill overlooking the village, Chico parts company with them, realizing he wants to stay with Petra. Chris and Vin bid farewell to the village elder, who tells them that only the villagers have really won, whereas the gunslingers are ""like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on."" As they pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris admits, ""The Old Man was right. Only the farmers won. We lost. We\'ll always lose.""[8][9]']]"

Eisenhower warns about the build-up of the ""military-industrial complex"". He is succeeded by John F. Kennedy as president, whose time in office is marked by the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis until his assassination in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Kennedy\'s suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit but is killed by Jack Ruby. New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and his team investigate potential New Orleans links to the JFK assassination, including private pilot David Ferrie, but their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government and Garrison closes the investigation.', 'The investigation is reopened in 1966 after Garrison reads the Warren Report and notices what he believes to be multiple inaccuracies. Garrison and his staff interrogate people involved with Oswald and Ferrie. One such witness is Willie O\'Keefe, a male prostitute serving five years in prison for soliciting, who says he witnessed Ferrie discussing about assassinating the President, as well as briefly meeting Oswald, and romantically involved with a man called ""Clay Bertrand"". Garrison and his team theorise Oswald was an agent of the Intelligence Agency and was framed for the assassination. ', 'In 1967, Garrison and his team talk to several witnesses to the Kennedy assassination, including Jean Hill, a teacher who says she witnessed a gunman shooting from the grassy knoll, that Secret Service threatened her into saying three shots came from the book depository, and her testimony was altered by the Warren Commission. Garrison\'s staff also test fire an empty rifle from the Texas School Book Depository from which Oswald was alleged to have shot Kennedy and conclude that Oswald was too poor a marksman to make the shots, indicating more than one shooter were involved. Garrison comes to believe New Orleans-based international businessman Clay Shaw is the same man as Bertrand. When Shaw is interrogated, the businessman denies any knowledge of meeting Ferrie, O\'Keefe or Oswald. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ruby and Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Garrison meets a high-level figure in Washington D.C. who identifies himself as ""X"". He suggests a coup d\'état at the highest levels of government, implicating members of the CIA, the Mafia, the military-industrial complex, Secret Service, FBI, and Kennedy\'s vice-president and then president Lyndon Baines Johnson as either co-conspirators or as having motives to cover up the truth of the assassination. X suggests that Kennedy was killed because he wanted to pull the United States out of the Vietnam War and dismantle the CIA. X encourages Garrison to keep digging and prosecute Shaw. Shaw is soon charged with conspiring to murder the President.', ""Some of Garrison's staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods, and leave the investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Garrison suspects a connection with the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy."", 'The trial of Clay Shaw takes place in 1969. Garrison presents the court with a dismissal of the single-bullet theory, proposing a scenario involving three assassins firing six shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and Tippit, but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. Members of that jury state publicly that they believe there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy.']]"

In 1914, his father inherited the Chapman baronetcy based at Killua Castle, the ancestral family home in County Westmeath, Ireland.[13][14] The couple had five sons, Thomas (called ""Ned"" by his immediate family) being the second eldest. From Wales, the family moved to Kirkcudbright, Galloway, in southwestern Scotland, then to Dinard in Brittany, then to Jersey.[15]', 'The family lived at Langley Lodge (now demolished) from 1894 to 1896, set in private woods between the eastern borders of the New Forest and Southampton Water in Hampshire.[16] The residence was isolated, and young Lawrence had many opportunities for outdoor activities and waterfront visits.[17] Victorian-Edwardian Britain was a very conservative society, where the majority of people were Christians who considered premarital and extramarital sex to be shameful, and children born out of wedlock were born in disgrace.[18] Lawrence was always something of an outsider, a bastard who could never hope to achieve the same level of social acceptance and success that others could expect who were born legitimate, and no girl from a respectable family would ever marry a bastard.[18]', 'In the summer of 1896, the family moved to 2, Polstead Road in Oxford,[19] where they lived until 1921. Lawrence attended the City of Oxford High School for Boys from 1896 until 1907,[20] where one of the four houses was later named ""Lawrence"" in his honour; the school closed in 1966.[21] Lawrence and one of his brothers became commissioned officers in the Church Lads\' Brigade at St Aldate\'s Church.[22]', 'Lawrence claimed that he ran away from home around 1905 and served for a few weeks as a boy soldier with the Royal Garrison Artillery at St Mawes Castle in Cornwall, from which he was bought out.

Shaw accepts a promotion to colonel commanding the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the first all-black regiments in the Union Army. He asks his friend Cabot Forbes to serve as his second in command, with the rank of major. Their first volunteer is Thomas Searles, a bookish, free African-American. Other recruits include John Rawlins, Jupiter Sharts, Trip, and a mute teenage drummer boy.', ""The men learn that in response to the Emancipation Proclamation, the Confederacy has issued an order that all black soldiers will be returned to slavery. Black soldiers found in a Union uniform will be executed as well as their white officers. They are offered but turn down a chance to take an honorable discharge. They undergo rigorous training from Sergeant-Major Mulcahy, who is particularly hard on Searles. Despite Mulcahy's treatment of his friend, Shaw reluctantly realizes the tough discipline is needed to prepare them for the coming challenges the regiment must face."", ""Trip goes AWOL and is caught; Shaw orders him flogged in front of the regiment. He then learns that Trip left to find regular-issue shoes because his men are being denied these supplies. Shaw confronts the base's racist quartermaster on their behalf. Shaw also supports his men in a pay dispute; the federal government decrees that black soldiers will only be paid $10, not the $13 per month all white soldiers receive. When the men, led by Trip, begin tearing up their pay vouchers in protest of this unequal treatment, Shaw tears up his own voucher in support of his men. In recognition of the leadership he has displayed, Rawlins is promoted by Shaw to the rank of sergeant major."", 'Once the 54th completes its training, the 54th regiment is transferred to serve under the command of Brigadier General Charles Harker. On the way to South Carolina, the 54th is ordered by Colonel James Montgomery to sack and burn Darien, Georgia. Shaw initially refuses to obey an unlawful order but reluctantly agrees under threat of facing a court-martial and being relieved of his command. He continues to lobby his superiors to allow his regiment to join the fight, as its duties to date have involved mostly manual labor. Shaw finally gets the 54th a combat assignment after he blackmails Harker by threatening to report the illegal activities he has discovered. In its first battle at James Island, South Carolina, the 54th successfully repels a Confederate attack that had routed other units. During the battle, Searles is wounded but saves Trip. Shaw offers Trip the honor of bearing the regimental flag in battle. He declines, unsure if winning the war would result in a better life for ex-slaves like himself.', 'General George Strong informs Shaw along with other commanders of a major campaign to secure a foothold at Charleston Harbor. This involves assaulting Morris Island and capturing Fort Wagner, whose only landward approach is a strip of open beach; a charge is certain to result in heavy casualties. Shaw volunteers the 54th to lead the attack. The night before the battle, the black soldiers conduct a religious service. Several make emotional speeches to inspire others, including Trip, who finally embraces his fellow soldiers. On its way to the battlefield, the 54th is cheered by the same Union troops who had scorned them earlier.', ""The 54th leads the dusk charge on the fort, suffering serious losses. As night falls, the regiment is pinned down against the fort's walls. Attempting to encourage his men forward, Shaw is killed by numerous gunshots. Trip, despite his previous assertion that he would not do it, lifts the flag to rally the soldiers to continue, but he too is soon shot dead. Forbes and Rawlins take charge, and the soldiers break through the fort's outer defenses. Seemingly on the brink of victory, Forbes, Rawlins, Searles, Sharts, and the two color sergeants are fired upon by Confederate artillery. The morning after the battle, the beach is littered with the bodies of black and white Union soldiers; the Confederate flag is raised over the fort. The dead Union soldiers are buried in a mass communal grave, with Shaw and Trip's bodies next to each other."", 'A textual epilogue reveals that while Fort Wagner never fell to the Union Army, the courage demonstrated by the 54th resulted in the United States accepting thousands of black men for combat, and President Abraham Lincoln credited them with helping to turn the tide of the war.']]"

Among the men to volunteer for the mission are Witt (who has since rejoined the company during the battle), Doll, and Bell. Captain Gaff is given command of the detachment, and they proceed up the hill toward the bunker.

He offers to arrange a Silver Star for Staros, to avoid the unit's name being tarnished for having an officer removed from command. During this time, Bell receives a letter from his wife, informing him that she has fallen in love with another man and seeks a divorce. Witt, meanwhile, comes across some of the locals and notices that, unlike the idyllic life he'd shared with the Melanesian natives when he went AWOL, the villagers have grown distant and distrustful of outsiders, and regularly quarrel with each other."", 'Weeks later, the company is sent on patrol up a river under the command of the inexperienced Lieutenant Band.

The two commiserate and drunkenly lament the state of their industry. The following night, Beale announces on live television that he will commit suicide on next Tuesday\'s broadcast. UBS immediately tries to fire him after this incident, but Schumacher intervenes so that Beale can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises to apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches into a rant about life being ""bullshit."" Beale\'s outburst causes ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher\'s dismay, the UBS upper echelons decide to exploit the situation rather than downplay it. When Beale\'s ratings seem to have topped out, programming chief Diana Christensen reaches out to Schumacher with an offer to help ""develop"" the show. He declines the professional proposal, but accepts a more personal pitch from Christensen and the two begin an affair.', 'When Schumacher decides to end Beale\'s ""angry man"" format, Christensen persuades her boss, Frank Hackett, to slot the evening news show under the entertainment programming division banner so she can develop it. Hackett agrees, bullying the UBS executives to consent and fire Schumacher.

Soon afterward, Beale is hosting a new program called The Howard Beale Show, top-billed as ""the mad prophet of the airwaves"". Ultimately, the show becomes the most highly rated program on television, and Beale finds new celebrity preaching his angry message in front of a live studio audience that, on cue, chants his signature catchphrase en masse: ""We\'re as mad as hell, and we\'re not going to take this anymore!"" Max and Diana\'s romance withers as the show flourishes, but in the flush of high ratings, the two ultimately find their way back together, and Schumacher leaves his wife of over 25 years for Christensen.', 'Christensen, seeking just one hit show, cuts a deal with a band of terrorists called the Ecumenical Liberation Army (ELA) for a new docudrama series, The Mao Tse-Tung Hour, for the upcoming fall season, for which the ELA will provide exclusive footage of their activities. Her liaison, Communist Party USA representative Laureen Hobbs, initially objects to the promotion of violent terrorism, believing Americans are ""not yet ready for open revolt"" and that the ELA will harm left-wing causes in America, but relents after Christensen promises her total editorial control of the weekly prime-time TV program.', 'When Beale discovers that Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the conglomerate parent of UBS, will be bought out by an even larger Saudi conglomerate, he launches an on-screen tirade against the deal and urges viewers to pressure the White House to stop it. This panics top network brass because UBS\'s debt load has made the merger essential for its survival. Beale meets with CCA chairman Arthur Jensen, who explicates his own ""corporate cosmology"" to Beale, describing the inter-relatedness of the participants in the international economy and the illusory nature of nationality distinctions. Jensen persuades Beale to abandon his populist message and preach his new ""evangel"". Christensen\'s fanatical devotion to her job and emotional emptiness ultimately drive Schumacher away and back to his wife, and he warns his former lover that she will self-destruct if she continues running her career at its current pace.', ""Audiences find Beale's new sermons on the dehumanization of society depressing and ratings start to slip, yet Jensen will not allow UBS to fire Beale, despite protestations from Hackett, who fears a loss of ad revenue, and Hobbs, who fears that Beale's slipping ratings will harm viewer numbers for The Mao Tse-Tung Hour. Seeing its two-for-the-price-of-one value—solving the Beale problem plus sparking a boost in season-opener ratings—Christensen, Hackett, and the other executives decide to hire the ELA to assassinate Beale on the air. The assassination succeeds, putting an end to The Howard Beale Show and kicking off a second season of The Mao Tse-Tung Hour."", 'As Beale lies bleeding on the set, a camera swings over the body in a crane shot — the tight depth of field of this final shot results in the camera apparently running over the corpse. It then cuts to four television screens, three displaying news reports covering Beale\'s death, and the bottom-left displaying a contemporary commercial. The overlapping audio creates an unintelligible cacophony. Each news report plays out, two cutting to a different commercial, while the bottom-left screen replays Beale\'s death in slow-motion. The screens momentarily freeze, and a voiceover proclaims the film ""the story of Howard Beale, the first known instance of a man who was killed because he had lousy ratings."" All of the screens fade to black, except for a still-frame of the murder. The overlapping audio slowly resolves throughout the credits, finally ending in a sound effect of a single news teletype.']]"

Although Martin tends to Ethan\'s wound, he is furious with him for attempting to kill Debbie, and wishes him dead. ""That\'ll be the day,"" Ethan replies, as they return home.', 'Meanwhile, Charlie McCorry has been courting Laurie in Martin\'s absence.

Several of their previous drummers died in strange circumstances: spontaneous human combustion (Peter James Bond), a ""bizarre gardening accident"" (John ""Stumpy"" Pepys), and choking on vomit (Eric ""Stumpy Joe"" Childs – ""someone else\'s vomit""). Segments of Marty\'s film show David and Nigel to be competent but dimwitted and immature musicians. At one point, Nigel shows Marty a custom-made amplifier that has volume knobs that go up to eleven, believing this would make their output louder.', ""Several of the band's tour shows are canceled because of low ticket sales, and major retailers refuse to sell Smell the Glove because of its sexist cover art. Tensions arise between the band and their manager Ian Faith. David's girlfriend Jeanine, a manipulative yoga and astrology devotee, joins the group on tour and participates in band meetings, influencing their costumes and stage presentation. The band's distributor opts to release Smell the Glove with an entirely black cover without consulting the band.

However, Nigel, rushing a sketch on a napkin, mislabels its dimensions; the resulting prop is only 18\xa0inches high rather than 18\xa0feet, making the group a laughing stock. The group blames Ian, and when David suggests Jeanine should co-manage the group, Ian quits. The tour continues, rescheduled into smaller and smaller venues. Nigel is marginalized by Jeanine and David. At a gig at a United States Air Force base, Nigel is upset by an equipment malfunction and quits mid-performance. At their next gig, in an amphitheater at an amusement park, the band finds their repertoire is severely limited without Nigel, and improvise an experimental ""Jazz Odyssey"", which is poorly received.', 'At the last show of the tour, David and Derek consider exploring old side projects, such as a musical theatre production about Jack the Ripper. Before they go on stage, Nigel arrives to tell them that their song ""Sex Farm"" has become a major hit in Japan, and that Ian wants to arrange a tour there. As the band performs, David invites Nigel onstage, reuniting them, which excites everyone but Jeanine. With Ian reinstalled as manager, Spinal Tap performs a series of sold-out shows in Japan, despite the loss of drummer Mick, who explodes onstage.']]"

Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go. Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back. Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene.

Brian later grows up into an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea. While listening to Jesus\'s Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel, Judith. His desire for her and hatred of the Romans, further exaggerated by his mother revealing Brian himself is half-Roman, inspire him to join the ""People\'s Front of Judea"" (PFJ), one of many fractious and bickering independence movements which spend more time fighting each other than they do the Romans.', ""Brian participates in an abortive attempt by the PFJ to kidnap the wife of Roman governor Pontius Pilate but is captured by the palace guards. Escaping when the guards suffer paroxysms of laughter over Pilate's speech impediment, Brian winds up trying to blend in among prophets preaching in a busy plaza, repeating fragments of Jesus' sermons. He stops his sermon mid-sentence when some Roman soldiers depart, leaving his small but intrigued audience demanding to know more. Brian grows frantic when people start following him and declare him to be the messiah.

Brian sneaks out the back, only to be captured by the Romans and is sentenced to crucifixion. In celebration of Passover, a crowd has assembled outside the palace of Pilate, who offers to pardon a prisoner of their choice. The crowd shouts out names containing the letter ""r"", mocking Pilate\'s rhotacistic speech impediment. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes, and Pilate agrees to ""welease Bwian"".[10]', 'His order is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a scene that parodies the climax of the film Spartacus, various crucified people all claim to be ""Brian"" so they can be freed and the wrong man is released. Other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as the PFJ and then Judith praise his martyrdom, while his mother expresses regret for having raised him. Hope is renewed when a crack suicide squad from the ""Judean People\'s Front"" charges and prompts the Roman soldiers to flee; however, the squad commits mass suicide as a form of political protest. Condemned to a slow and painful death, Brian finds his spirits lifted by his fellow sufferers, who cheerfully sing ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.""[11]']]"

For this short period of time, his spasms disappear. Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard returns to his catatonic state soon after. The other patients\' fears are similarly realized as each eventually returns to catatonia, no matter how much their L-Dopa dosages are increased.', 'Sayer tells a group of grant donors to the hospital that although the ""awakening"" did not last, another kind\xa0– one of learning to appreciate and live life\xa0– took place. For example, he overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello (Julie Kavner) to go out for coffee, many months after he had declined a similar invitation from her.

Haunted by the death of his family, former policeman Max Rockatansky now roams the desert wilderness of a post-apocalyptic Australia in a scarred, black, supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special. Scavenging for food and petrol, Max\'s only companion is an Australian Cattle Dog. After driving off a gang led by the unhinged biker warrior Wez, and taking petrol from one of their wrecked vehicles, Max finds an apparently abandoned gyrocopter and decides to collect its fuel, but is ambushed by the pilot. Max manages to overpower him and spares his life in return for being led to an oil refinery that the pilot has discovered. When they arrive, Max finds the compound under siege by the Marauders, a motley gang of drivers and motorcyclists of which Wez is a member. The Marauders\' leader, a large masked man called ""Lord Humungus"", has his gang attacking the complex daily, believing that the compound contains fuel reserves.', ""Biding his time, Max sees an opportunity when several groups of the settlers attempt to break out of the besieged compound and are chased down by the Marauders. Max rescues the single survivor of one group and strikes a deal to return him to the complex in exchange for fuel. The man dies from his wounds shortly after Max takes him back, and the settlers' leader Papagallo reneges on the deal. The settlers are on the verge of killing Max when the Marauders return. Although Wez wants to kill all the settlers after his partner is killed by a metal boomerang thrown by a feral child living within the complex, Humungus offers the settlers safe passage in exchange for the fuel supply."", ""Max offers an alternative deal to Papagallo: he will procure a vehicle to haul the settler's tanker if they return his car and give him as much fuel as he can carry. The settlers accept, but keep his car until he returns. That night, carrying fuel for the truck, Max sneaks out on foot with the Feral Kid's help. He again encounters the Gyro Captain and forces him to carry the fuel to the truck, a Mack semi which Max discovered after his initial encounter with Wez. With aerial support from the Gyro Captain, Max drives the semi through the Marauders' encampment into the compound. Though the settlers want Max to escape with them to the Far North, (revealed to be the Sunshine Coast by a set of postcards), Max opts to collect his fuel and leave. However, while attempting to break through the siege, Max is seriously injured when his car is wrecked after being run off the road by Wez in Lord Humungus's nitrous oxide-equipped vehicle. One of the Marauders kills Max's dog with a crossbow and is about to kill Max when the Toadie's attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special's tanks triggers the car to self-destruct; both Marauders are killed in the explosion. Max is left for dead, but the Gyro Captain rescues him and flies him back to the compound."", 'Despite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired and now armored truck with the fuel tanker. He leaves the compound, accompanied by the Feral Kid with Papagallo and several of the settlers in armored vehicles to provide protection. Lord Humungus and most of his warriors pursue the tanker, leaving the remaining settlers free to flee the compound in a ramshackle bus, rigging the compound to explode. After Papagallo and the defenders are killed during the chase, and the Gyro Captain shot down, Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone against the Marauders as Wez boards the truck to kill the two of them.', 'However, the semi\'s head-on collision with Humungus\' car kills both him and Wez as the out-of-control truck rolls off the road while the surviving Marauders leave. As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he sees not oil, but sand, leaking from the tank, revealing it to be a decoy which allowed the other settlers to escape with the fuel in oil drums hidden inside their vehicles. With Papagallo dead, the Gyro Captain succeeds him as their chief and leads the settlers to the coast, where they establish the ""Great Northern Tribe"". The Feral Kid (as an adult and the Northern Tribe\'s new leader) is revealed as the film\'s narrator, reminiscing about the Road Warrior, who departed for parts unknown, and now lives on only in legend.']]"

Alexandria, desperate to help Roy, sneaks out of bed to the pharmacy. She climbs onto the cabinet but loses her footing, falls, and sustains a severe head injury.

Other critics considered that it was too culturally sanitized, ""middlebrow"" and superficial; Philip Roth, writing in The New Yorker, called it shtetl kitsch.

Contrary to popular belief, the ""title of the musical does not refer to any specific painting"".[6]', 'During rehearsals, one of the stars, Jewish actor Zero Mostel, feuded with Robbins, whom he held in contempt, because Robbins had testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee and hid his Jewish heritage from the public.

He is then captured and brought back to New York City for public exhibition.,"[[' The King Kong character was conceived and created by American filmmaker Merian C. Cooper. In the original film, the character\'s name is Kong, a name given to him by the inhabitants of the fictional ""Skull Island"" in the Indian Ocean, where Kong lives along with other oversized animals, such as plesiosaurs, pterosaurs and various dinosaurs. An American film crew, led by Carl Denham, captures Kong and takes him to New York City to be exhibited as the ""Eighth Wonder of the World"".', 'Kong escapes and climbs the Empire State Building, only to fall from the skyscraper after being attacked by biplanes with guns. Denham comments ""it wasn\'t the airplanes, It was beauty killed the beast"", for he climbs the building in the first place only in an attempt to protect Ann Darrow, an actress originally kidnapped by the natives of the island and offered up to Kong as a sacrifice (in the 1976 remake, her character is named ""Dwan"").', 'A pseudo-documentary about Skull Island that appears on the DVD for the 2005 remake (originally seen on the Sci-Fi Channel at the time of its theatrical release) gives Kong\'s scientific name as Megaprimatus kong[16] (""Megaprimatus"", deriving from the prefix ""mega-"" and the Latin words ""primate"" and ""primatus"", means ""big primate"" or ""big supreme being"") and states that his species may be related to Gigantopithecus, though that genus of giant ape is more closely related to orangutans than to gorillas.', 'Merian C. Cooper became fascinated by gorillas at the age of 6.[17] In 1899, he was given a book from his uncle called Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa.[18] The book (written in 1861), chronicled the adventures of Paul Du Chaillu in Africa and his various encounters with the natives and wildlife there.[19] Cooper became fascinated with the stories involving the gorillas, in particular, Du Chaillu\'s depiction of a particular gorilla known for its ""extraordinary size"",[20] that the natives described as ""invincible"" and the ""King of the African Forest"".[21] When Du Chaillu and some natives encountered a gorilla later in the book he described it as a ""hellish dream creature"" that was ""half man, half beast"".[22]', 'As an adult, Cooper became involved in the motion picture industry. While filming The Four Feathers in Africa, he came into contact with a family of baboons.[23] This gave him the idea to make a picture about primates.[24] A year later when he got to RKO, Cooper wanted to film a ""terror gorilla picture"". As the story was being fleshed out, Cooper decided to make his gorilla giant sized. Cooper stated that the idea of Kong fighting warplanes on top of a building came from him seeing a plane flying over the New York Insurance Building, then the tallest building in the world.[25] He came up with the ending before the rest of the story as he stated, ""Without any conscious effort of thought I immediately saw in my mind\'s eye a giant gorilla on top of the building"".[26] Cooper also was influenced by Douglas Burden\'s accounts of the Komodo dragon,[27] and wanted to pit his terror gorilla against dinosaur-sized versions of these reptiles, stating to Burden, ""I also had firmly in mind to giantize both the gorilla and your dragons to make them really huge. However I always believed in personalizing and focusing attention on one main character and from the very beginning I intended to make it the gigantic gorilla, no matter what else I surrounded him with"".[27] Around this time, Cooper began to refer to his project as a ""giant terror gorilla picture"" featuring ""a gigantic semi-humanoid gorilla pitted against modern civilization"".[28]', 'When designing King Kong, Cooper wanted him to be a nightmarish gorilla monster. As he described Kong in a 1930 memo, ""His hands and feet have the size and strength of steam shovels; his girth is that of a steam boiler. This is a monster with the strength of a hundred men. But more terrifying is the head—a nightmare head with bloodshot eyes and jagged teeth set under a thick mat of hair, a face half-beast half-human"".[29] Willis O\'Brien created an oil painting depicting the giant gorilla menacing a jungle heroine and hunter for Cooper.[30][31] However, when it came time for O\'Brien and Marcel Delgado to sculpt the animation model, Cooper decided to backpedal on the half-human look for the creature and became adamant that Kong be a gorilla. O\'Brien on the other hand, wanted him to be almost human-like to gain audience empathy, and told Delgado to ""make that ape almost human"".[32] Cooper laughed at the end result, saying that it looked like a cross between a monkey and a man with very long hair.[32] For the second model, O\'Brien again asked Delgado to add human features but to tone it down somewhat. The end result (which was rejected) was described as looking like a missing link.[32] Disappointed, Cooper stated, ""I want Kong to be the fiercest, most brutal, monstrous damned thing that has ever been seen!""[32] On December 22, 1931, Cooper got the dimensions of a bull gorilla from the American Museum of Natural History telling O\'Brien, ""Now that\'s what I want!""[32] When the final model was created, it had the basic look of a gorilla but managed to retain some human-like qualities. For example, Delgado streamlined the body by removing the distinctive paunch and rump of a gorilla.[33] O\'Brien would incorporate some characteristics and nuances of an earlier creature he had created in 1915 for the silent short The Dinosaur and the Missing Link into the general look and personality of Kong, even going as far as to refer to the creature as ""Kong\'s ancestor"".[34][35] When it came time to film, Cooper agreed that Kong should walk upright at times (mostly in the New York sequences) in order to appear more intimidating.[36]', 'Merian C. Cooper was very fond of strong, hard-sounding words that started with the letter ""K"". Some of his favorite words were ""Komodo"", ""Kodiak"" and ""Kodak"".[37] When Cooper was envisioning his giant terror gorilla idea, he wanted to capture a real gorilla from the Congo and have it fight a real Komodo dragon on Komodo Island (this scenario would eventually evolve into Kong\'s battle with the tyrannosaur on Skull Island when the film was produced a few years later at RKO). Cooper\'s friend Douglas Burden\'s trip to the island of Komodo and his encounter with the Komodo dragons was a big influence on the Kong story.[38] Cooper was fascinated by Burden\'s adventures as chronicled in his book Dragon Lizards of Komodo where he referred to the animal as the ""King of Komodo"".[37] It was this phrase along with ""Komodo"" and ""Kongo""  [sic] (and his overall love for hard sounding ""K""-words)[39] that gave him the idea to name the giant ape ""Kong"". He loved the name, as it had a ""mystery sound"" to it.', 'After Cooper got to RKO, British mystery writer Edgar Wallace was contracted to write the first draft of the screen story. It was simply referred to as ""The Beast"". RKO executives were unimpressed with the bland title. David O. Selznick suggested Jungle Beast as the film\'s new title,[40] but Cooper was unimpressed and wanted to name the film after the main character. He stated he liked the ""mystery word"" aspect of Kong\'s name and that the film should carry ""the name of the leading mysterious, romantic, savage creature of the story"" such as with Dracula and Frankenstein.[40] RKO sent a memo to Cooper suggesting the titles Kong: King of Beasts, Kong: The Jungle King, and Kong: The Jungle Beast, which combined his and Selznick\'s proposed titles.[40] As time went on, Cooper would eventually name the story simply Kong while Ruth Rose was writing the final version of the screenplay. Because David O. Selznick thought that audiences would think that the film, with the one word title of Kong, would be mistaken as a docudrama like Grass and Chang, which were one-word titled films that Cooper had earlier produced, he added the ""King"" to Kong\'s name in order to differentiate it.[41]', 'In his first appearance in King Kong (1933), Kong was a gigantic prehistoric ape.[42] While gorilla-like in appearance, he had a vaguely humanoid look and at times walked upright in an anthropomorphic manner.[36]', 'Like most simians, Kong possesses semi-human intelligence and great physical strength. Kong\'s size changes drastically throughout the course of the film. While creator Merian C. Cooper envisioned Kong as being ""40 to 50 feet tall"",[43] animator Willis O\'Brien and his crew built the models and sets scaling Kong to be only 18 feet (5.5\xa0m) tall on Skull Island, and rescaled to be 24 feet (7.3\xa0m) tall in New York.[44]', ""This did not stop Cooper from playing around with Kong's size as he directed the special effect sequences; by manipulating the sizes of the miniatures and the camera angles, he made Kong appear a lot larger than O'Brien wanted, even as large as 60 feet (18.3\xa0m) in some scenes."", 'As Cooper stated in an interview:', ' ', ""Concurrently, the Kong bust made for the film was built in scale with a 40-foot (12.2\xa0m) ape,[46] while the full sized hand of Kong was built in scale with a 70-foot (21.3\xa0m) ape.[47] Meanwhile, RKO's promotional materials listed Kong's official height as 50 feet (15.2\xa0m).[42]"", 'In the 1960s, Toho Studios from Japan licensed the character for the films King Kong vs. Godzilla and King Kong Escapes. For more details on these versions of the character, see below.', 'In 1975, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis paid RKO for the remake rights to King Kong. This resulted in King Kong (1976). This Kong was an upright walking anthropomorphic ape, appearing even more human-like than the original. Also like the original, this Kong had semi-human intelligence and vast strength. In the 1976 film, Kong was scaled to be 42 feet (12.8\xa0m) tall on Skull island and rescaled to be 55 feet (16.8\xa0m) tall in New York.[48] Ten years later, Dino De Laurentiis got the approval from Universal to do a sequel called King Kong Lives. This Kong had more or less the same appearance and abilities, but tended to walk on his knuckles more often and was enlarged, scaled to 60 feet (18.3\xa0m).[49]', ""Universal Studios had planned to do a King Kong remake as far back as 1976. They finally followed through almost 30 years later, with a three-hour film directed by Peter Jackson. Jackson opted to make Kong a gigantic silverback gorilla without any anthropomorphic features. This Kong looked and behaved more like a real gorilla: he had a large herbivore's belly, walked on his knuckles without any upright posture, and even beat his chest with his palms as opposed to clenched fists. In order to ground his Kong in realism, Jackson and the Weta Digital crew gave a name to his fictitious species Megaprimatus kong and suggested it to have evolved from the Gigantopithecus. Kong was the last of his kind. He was portrayed in the film as being quite old, with graying fur and battle-worn with scars, wounds, and a crooked jaw from his many fights against rival creatures. He is the dominant being on the island, the king of his world. But, like his film predecessors, he possesses considerable intelligence and great physical strength; he also appears far more nimble and agile. This Kong was scaled to a consistent height of 25 feet (7.6\xa0m) tall on both Skull Island and in New York.[50] Jackson describes his central character: "", ""In the 2017 film Kong: Skull Island, Kong is scaled to be 104 feet (31.7\xa0m) tall,[52] making it the second largest and largest American incarnation in the series until the 2021 film Godzilla vs. Kong, in which he became the largest incarnation in the series, standing at 337 feet (102.7\xa0m).[53] Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts stated in regard to Kong's immense stature: "", ' He also stated that the original 1933 look was the inspiration for the design, saying: ', ' Co-producer Mary Parent also stated that Kong is still young and not fully grown as she explains, ""Kong is an adolescent when we meet him in the film; he\'s still growing into his role as alpha"".[56]', ""While one of the most famous movie icons in history, King Kong's intellectual property status has been questioned since his creation, featuring in numerous allegations and court battles. The rights to the character have always been split up with no single exclusive rights holder. Different parties have also contested that various aspects are public domain material and therefore ineligible for copyright status."", 'When Merian C. Cooper created King Kong, he assumed that he owned the character, which he had conceived in 1929, outright. Cooper maintained that he had only licensed the character to RKO for the initial film and sequel, but had otherwise owned his own creation. In 1935, Cooper began to feel something was amiss when he was trying to get a Tarzan vs. King Kong project off the ground for Pioneer Pictures (where he had assumed management of the company). After David O. Selznick suggested the project to Cooper, the flurry of legal activity over using the Kong character that followed—Pioneer had become a completely independent company by this time and access to properties that RKO felt were theirs was no longer automatic—gave Cooper pause as he came to realize that he might not have full control over this product of his own imagination after all.[57]', ""Years later in 1962, Cooper found out that RKO was licensing the character through John Beck to Toho studios in Japan for a film project called King Kong vs. Godzilla. Cooper had assumed his rights were unassailable and was bitterly opposed to the project. In 1963 he filed a lawsuit to enjoin distribution of the movie against John Beck, as well as Toho and Universal (the film's U.S. copyright holder).[58] Cooper discovered that RKO had also profited from licensed products featuring the King Kong character such as model kits produced by Aurora Plastics Corporation. Cooper's executive assistant, Charles B. FitzSimons, stated that these companies should be negotiating through him and Cooper for such licensed products and not RKO. In a letter to Robert Bendick, Cooper stated:"", 'Cooper and his legal team offered up various documents to bolster the case that Cooper owned King Kong and had only licensed the character to RKO for two films, rather than selling him outright. Many people vouched for Cooper\'s claims, including David O. Selznick, who had written a letter to Mr. A. Loewenthal of the Famous Artists Syndicate in Chicago in 1932 stating (in regard to Kong), ""The rights of this are owned by Mr. Merian C. Cooper.""[59] But Cooper had lost key documents through the years (he discovered these papers were missing after he returned from his World War II military service) such as a key informal yet binding letter from Mr. Ayelsworth (the then-president of the RKO Studio Corp.) and a formal binding letter from Mr. B. B. Kahane (the current president of RKO Studio Corp.) confirming that Cooper had only licensed the rights to the character for the two RKO pictures and nothing more.[60]', ""Without these letters, it seemed Cooper's rights were relegated to the Lovelace novelization that he had copyrighted (he was able to make a deal for a Bantam Books paperback reprint and a Gold Key comic adaptation of the novel, but that was all that he could do). Cooper's lawyer had received a letter from John Beck's lawyer, Gordon E. Youngman, that stated:"", 'In a letter addressed to Douglas Burden, Cooper lamented:', ""The rights over the character did not flare up again until 1975, when Universal Studios and Dino De Laurentiis were fighting over who would be able to do a King Kong remake for release the following year. De Laurentiis came up with $200,000 to buy the remake rights from RKO.[62] When Universal got wind of this, they filed a lawsuit against RKO, claiming that they had a verbal agreement from them regarding the remake. During the legal battles that followed, which eventually included RKO countersuing Universal, as well as De Laurentiis filing a lawsuit claiming interference, Colonel Richard Cooper (Merian's son and now head of the Cooper estate) jumped into the fray.[63]"", ""During the battles, Universal discovered that the copyright of the Lovelace novelization had expired without renewal, thus making the King Kong story a public domain one. Universal argued that they should be able to make a movie based on the novel without infringing on anyone's copyright because the characters in the story were in the public domain within the context of the public domain story.[64] Richard Cooper then filed a cross-claim against RKO claiming that, while the publishing rights to the novel had not been renewed, his estate still had control over the plot/story of King Kong.[63]"", 'In a four-day bench trial in Los Angeles, Judge Manuel Real made the final decision and gave his verdict on November 24, 1976, affirming that the King Kong novelization and serialization were indeed in the public domain, and Universal could make its movie as long as it did not infringe on original elements in the 1933 RKO film,[65] which had not passed into the public domain[66] (Universal postponed their plans to film a King Kong movie, called The Legend of King Kong, for at least 18 months, after cutting a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that included a percentage of box office profits from his remake).[67]', 'However, on December 6, 1976, Judge Real made a subsequent ruling, which held that all the rights in the name, character, and story of King Kong (outside of the original film and its sequel) belonged to Merian C. Cooper\'s estate. This ruling, which became known as the ""Cooper judgment"", expressly stated that it would not change the previous ruling that publishing rights of the novel and serialization were in the public domain. It was a huge victory that affirmed the position Merian C. Cooper had maintained for years.[65] Shortly thereafter, Richard Cooper sold all his rights (excluding worldwide book and periodical publishing rights) to Universal in December 1976. In 1980 Judge Real dismissed the claims that were brought forth by RKO and Universal four years earlier and reinstated the Cooper judgement.[68]', 'In 1982 Universal filed a lawsuit against Nintendo, which had created an impish ape character called Donkey Kong in 1981 and was reaping huge profits over the video game machines. Universal claimed that Nintendo was infringing on its copyright because Donkey Kong was a blatant rip-off of King Kong.[68] During the court battle and subsequent appeal, the courts ruled that Universal did not have exclusive trademark rights to the King Kong character. The courts ruled that trademark was not among the rights Cooper had sold to Universal, indicating that ""Cooper plainly did not obtain any trademark rights in his judgment against RKO, since the California district court specifically found that King Kong had no secondary meaning.""[66] While they had a majority of the rights, they did not outright own the King Kong name and character.[69] The courts ruling noted that the name, title, and character of Kong no longer signified a single source of origin so exclusive trademark rights were impossible.[70] The courts also pointed out that the Kong rights were held by three parties:', 'The judge then ruled that ""Universal thus owns only those rights in the King Kong name and character that RKO, Cooper, or DDL do not own.""[71]', 'The court of appeals would also note:', 'Because Universal misrepresented their degree of ownership of King Kong (claiming they had exclusive trademark rights when they knew that they did not) and tried to have it both ways in court regarding the ""public domain"" claims, the courts ruled that Universal acted in bad faith (see Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.). They were ordered to pay fines and all of Nintendo\'s legal costs from the lawsuit. That, along with the fact that the courts ruled that there was simply no likelihood of people confusing Donkey Kong with King Kong,[69] caused Universal to lose the case and the subsequent appeal.', ""Since the court case, Universal still retains the majority of the character rights. In 1986 they opened a King Kong ride called King Kong Encounter at their Universal Studios Tour theme park in Hollywood (which was destroyed in 2008 by a backlot fire), and followed it up with the Kongfrontation ride at their Orlando park in 1990 (which was closed down in 2002 due to maintenance issues). They also finally made a King Kong film of their own, King Kong (2005). In the summer of 2010, Universal opened a new 3D King Kong ride called King Kong: 360 3-D at their Hollywood park, replacing the destroyed King Kong Encounter.[73] On July 13, 2016, Universal opened a new King Kong attraction called Skull Island: Reign of Kong at Islands of Adventure in Orlando.[74] In July 2013, Legendary Pictures reached an agreement with Universal in which it will market, co-finance, and distribute Legendary's films for five years starting in 2014, the year that Legendary's similar agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures was set to expire. Later, in July 2014 at the San Diego Comic-Con, Legendary announced (as a product of its partnership with Universal), a King Kong origin story, initially titled Skull Island, with Universal distributing.[75] On December 12, 2014, the studio announced they had re-titled the film Kong: Skull Island. On September 10, 2015, it was announced that Universal would allow Legendary to move Kong: Skull Island to Warner Bros.,[76] so they could do a King Kong and Godzilla crossover film (in the continuity of the 2014 Godzilla movie), since Legendary still had the rights to make more Godzilla movies with Warner Bros. before their contract with Toho expired in 2020.[77][78]"", ""As noted above, Richard Cooper, through the Merian C. Cooper Estate, retained publishing rights for the content that Judge Real had ruled on December 6, 1976, belonged to Richard Cooper. In 1990, they licensed a six-issue comic book adaptation of the novelization of the 1933 film to Monster Comics, and commissioned an illustrated novel in 1994 called Anthony Browne's King Kong. In 2013, they became involved with a musical stage play based on the story, called King Kong: The Eighth Wonder of the World which premiered in June 2013 in Australia[79][80] and then on Broadway in November 2018.[81] The production is involved with Global Creatures, the company behind the Walking with Dinosaurs arena show.[82] In 1996, artist/writer Joe DeVito partnered the Merian C. Cooper estate to write and/or illustrate various publications based on Merian C. Cooper's King Kong property through his company, DeVito ArtWorks, LLC. Through this partnership, DeVito created the prequel/sequel story Skull Island on which DeVito based a pair of original novels relating the origin of King Kong: Kong: King of Skull Island, and King Kong of Skull Island. In addition, the Cooper/DeVito collaboration resulted in an origin-themed comic book miniseries with Boom! Studios,[83] an expanded rewrite of the original Lovelace novelization, Merian C. Cooper's King Kong, (the original novelization's publishing rights are still in the public domain), and various crossovers with other franchises such as Doc Savage, Tarzan[84] and Planet of the Apes.[85] In 2016, DeVito ArtWorks, through its licensing program, licensed its King Kong property to RocketFizz for use in the marketing of a soft drink called King Kong Cola.[86] and have plans for a live action TV show to be co-produced between MarVista Entertainment and IM Global.[87] In April 2016, Joe DeVito sued Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros., producers of the film Kong: Skull Island, for using elements of his Skull Island universe, which he claimed that he created and that the producers had used without his permission.[88]"", 'RKO (whose rights consisted of only the original film and its sequel) signed over the North American, Latin American and Australian distribution rights to its film library to Ted Turner in a period spanning 1986 to 1989 via his company Turner Entertainment. Turner merged his company into Time Warner (now WarnerMedia) in 1996, which is how Warner Bros. owns distribution rights in those regions to those two films today, with the copyright over the films (including King Kong and The Son of Kong) remaining with RKO Pictures, LLC (various companies distribute the RKO library in other territories). In 1998, Warner Bros. Family Entertainment released the direct-to-video animated musical film The Mighty Kong, which re-tells the plot of the original 1933 film. 19 years later; in 2017, Warners co-produced the film Kong: Skull Island and in 2021 co-produced the film Godzilla vs. Kong, after Legendary Pictures brought the projects over from Universal[89] to build up the MonsterVerse.', ""DDL (whose rights were limited to only their 1976 remake) did a sequel in 1986 called King Kong Lives (but they still needed Universal's permission to do so).[90] Today most of DDL's film library is owned by StudioCanal, which includes the rights to these two films. The domestic (North American) rights to the 1976 King Kong film still remain with the film's original distributor Paramount Pictures, with Trifecta Entertainment & Media handling television rights to the film via their license with Paramount.[citation needed]"", ""In the 1960s, Japanese studio Toho licensed the character from RKO and produced two films that featured the character, King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) and King Kong Escapes (1967). Toho's interpretation differed greatly from the original in size and abilities. Among kaiju, King Kong was suggested to be among the most powerful in terms of raw physical force, possessing strength and durability that rivaled that of Godzilla. As one of the few mammal-based kaiju, Kong's most distinctive feature was his intelligence. He demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt to an opponent's fighting style, identify and exploit weaknesses in an enemy, and utilize his environment to stage ambushes and traps.[91]"", ""In King Kong vs. Godzilla, Kong was scaled to be 45\xa0m (148\xa0ft) tall. This version of Kong was given the ability to harvest electricity as a weapon and draw strength from electrical voltage.[92] In King Kong Escapes, Kong was scaled to be 20\xa0m (66\xa0ft) tall. This version was more similar to the original, where he relied on strength and intelligence to fight and survive.[93] Rather than residing on Skull Island, Toho's version of Kong resided on Faro Island in King Kong vs. Godzilla and on Mondo Island in King Kong Escapes."", ""In 1966, Toho planned to produce Operation Robinson Crusoe: King Kong vs. Ebirah as a co-production with Rankin/Bass Productions, however Ishirō Honda was unavailable at the time to direct the film and, as a result, Rankin/Bass backed out of the project, along with the King Kong license.[94] Toho still proceeded with the production, replacing King Kong with Godzilla at the last minute and shot the film as Ebirah, Horror of the Deep. Elements of King Kong's character remained in the film, reflected in Godzilla's uncharacteristic behavior and attraction to the female character Daiyo.[95] Toho and Rankin/Bass later negotiated their differences and co-produced King Kong Escapes in 1967, loosely based on Rankin/Bass' animated show."", ""Toho Studios wanted to remake King Kong vs. Godzilla, which was the most successful of the entire Godzilla series of films, in 1991 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film, as well as to celebrate Godzilla's upcoming 40th anniversary. However, they were unable to obtain the rights to use Kong, and initially intended to use Mechani-Kong as Godzilla's next adversary.[96] But it was soon learned that even using a mechanical creature who resembled Kong would be just as problematic legally and financially for them. As a result, the film became Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, with one last failed attempt made to use Kong in 2004's Godzilla: Final Wars.[97]""]]"

As proof, he discreetly shows the name of Germany's top agent in Britain to Kramer, who silently affirms it, and has Kramer call a high-ranking officer on Kesselring's staff who testifies to Smith's identity as a German security officer. To test the three agents, Schmidt proposes that they write down the names of their fellow agents in Britain, to be compared to the list he has in his pocket. After the three finish their lists, Smith reveals that he was bluffing and that obtaining the true list of agents was the mission's true objective."", ""Meanwhile, Mary is visited by Sturmbannführer von Hapen, a Gestapo officer who is attracted to her, but he becomes suspicious of flaws in her cover story.

Schaffer seizes the opportunity to kill von Hapen and the other German officers with his silenced pistol. The group then makes its escape, along with Jones and the three British commandos/German spies. Schaffer sets explosives to create diversions around the castle while Smith leads the group to the radio room where he informs Rolland of their success and asks for a transport plane home. During the escape, Thomas is sacrificed as a decoy, while Berkeley and Christiansen try to flee but are killed by Smith. The team reunites with Heidi on the ground, boarding a bus they had prepared earlier as an escape vehicle. They battle their way onto an airfield and take off in their transport plane, where Turner welcomes them."", 'As Turner debriefs Smith about the mission, Smith reveals that the name Kramer confirmed as Germany\'s top agent in Britain was Turner\'s. Rolland had lured Turner and the others into participating so that MI6 could expose them; Smith\'s trusted partner Mary and the American Schaffer, who had no connection to MI6, had been assigned to the mission to ensure its success. Turner aims a gun at Smith, who reveals that Rolland has had the gun\'s firing pin removed. He permits Turner to jump out of the plane to his death to avoid being tried for treason and executed. Schaffer half-jokingly asks Smith to keep his next mission ""an all-British operation"".']]"

However, Lau alerts Hon, giving him enough time to get his henchmen to dispose of the evidence. After this incident, both Wong and Hon realise that they have a mole within their own organisation, placing them in a race against time to find out who the mole is. Chan nearly finds out Lau's identity when he tries to follow Lau after seeing him talking to Hon in a cinema; Lau manages to get away before Chan could see his face. By this time, both Chan and Lau are struggling with their double identities – Chan starts losing faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for ten years; Lau becomes more accustomed to the life of a police officer and wants to end his association with the triad."", 'At their next meeting on a rooftop, Wong wants to pull Chan out of undercover work for fear of his safety. However, Hon, who knows about the meeting from Lau, sends ""Crazy"" Keung and other henchmen to confront them.

However, back at the police headquarters, Chan discovers that Lau was the mole and leaves immediately. Lau, realising what has happened, erases Chan's file from the police database and makes a copy on his personal computer, intending to use the proof of Chan's identity as leverage, so that Chan would not reveal his real identity. Chan spends an evening with his therapist, Lee Sum-yee, with whom he has fallen in love. He sends to Lau a compact disc with a recording that Hon kept between himself and Lau; the disc inadvertently ends up in the hands of Lau's girlfriend, Mary."", 'Chan and Lau meet on the same rooftop where Wong was killed earlier. Chan disarms Lau and holds his pistol to Lau\'s head; Lau states calmly that he ""wants to be a good person"" now, but Chan rejects Lau\'s plea to help him conceal his criminal past. Inspector ""Big B"" arrives on the scene shortly and orders Chan to release Lau. Chan holds Lau as a hostage at gunpoint and backs into an elevator, but gets shot in the head by ""Big B"" when he moves his head from behind Lau. ""Big B"" then reveals to Lau that he is also a mole planted by Hon in the police force, and assures Lau that he has destroyed evidence of Lau\'s criminal associations. When they take the elevator to the ground floor, Lau kills ""Big B"".', 'The original ending shows Lau identifying himself as a cop to the police. Lee discovers records that prove Chan\'s identity as an undercover cop, while ""Big B"" is identified as the mole in the police force and the case is closed. Lau salutes Chan at his funeral, with Cheung and Lee present as well. A flashback reaffirms the point that Lau wished he had taken a different route in life.', 'A release for the Malaysian market uses an ending where the criminal is arrested, as the Malaysian government required films to show perpetrators receiving prosecution.[4] The Mainland China release has a different ending which shows Lau being confronted with evidence of him as the mole and getting arrested when he steps out of the elevator.[citation needed] The sequel Infernal Affairs III uses the original ending instead of the alternate one.']]"

The nuns claim that the adoption records were destroyed in a fire years earlier; they did not, however, lose the contract she was forced to sign decades ago forbidding her from contacting her son, which Martin considers suspicious. At a pub, the locals tell Martin that the convent burnt the records deliberately, and that most of the children were sold for £1,000 each to wealthy Americans.', ""Martin's investigation reaches a dead end in Ireland, but he receives a promising lead from the United States and invites Philomena to accompany him there. His contacts help him discover that Anthony was renamed Michael A. Hess, who became a lawyer and senior official in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations.

Hildegarde is unrepentant, saying that losing her son was Philomena's penance for having sex out of wedlock."", ""Martin demands an apology, telling her that what she did was un-Christian, but is speechless when Philomena instead chooses to forgive her of her own volition.

Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her.', ""Elliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah's sisters, Lee, and eventually begins an affair with her.  Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength.  Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick, who is much older.  She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her.  She leaves Frederick after admitting to having an affair with somebody.  For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Elliot's inability to end his marriage to Hannah.  Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else."", ""Hannah's ex-husband Mickey, a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story.

The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love."", ""Holly's story is the film's third main arc.  A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career.  After borrowing money from Hannah, she starts a catering business with April, a friend and fellow actress.  Holly and April end up as rivals in auditions for parts in Broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect, David.  Holly abandons the catering business after the romance with David fails and decides to try her hand at writing.  The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents.  She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah.  It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Elliot's marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee (having been transmitted first from Elliot).  Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details.  Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date."", ""A minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma and Evan.  They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own.

The aviator recounts the Little Prince asking him to draw a sheep. He drew two sheep (including a ram) before the Little Prince complained he needed a sheep that would live forever. The aviator drew a box with three holes saying that the sheep that he desired was inside it, which satisfied the Little Prince, much to the aviator\'s surprise.', 'The girl and the aviator continue to read and play together without the mother\'s knowledge. The aviator tells the girl about the Little Prince\'s home, ""Asteroid B-612"", covered in baobab sprouts. He states that after clearing away the sprouts, the Little Prince discovered and found and nurtured a Rose into maturity. Despite becoming his friend, she was rather selfish and both too young to know how to love each other, which caused the Little Prince to travel to elsewhere with a flock of birds. During his journey, he meets adults that live on other asteroids, such as a king, a conceited man, and a wealthy businessman. The Little Prince eventually landed on Earth, meeting a snake who tells him where he is. The little Prince then meets and befriends a red fox. After a while, the fox bade goodbye to the Little Prince, advising him to always see with his heart. The aviator gives the girl a stuffed fox as a gift, telling her that he will leave soon to go find the Little Prince.', 'The two decide to go out for her ""birthday"", but when they are pulled over by a police officer, the aviator is revealed to have no licence and the officer takes the girl home. Realising that she has not been following the plan, her infuriated mother redoubles her daughter\'s assignments. Nevertheless, the girl continues to read the story of the Little Prince, secretly visiting the aviator to find out the story\'s ending. The aviator tells her that the Little Prince had succumbed to a venomous snake bite to be reunited with his beloved Rose. Although the aviator assures her that he firmly believes the Little Prince succeeded, the girl, upset by the dark twist to the story, wishes that she had never met the aviator or heard the story. The girl tries to forget about the Little Prince, and focuses on her assignments.', 'Towards the summer\'s end, the aviator is hospitalised. Deciding to put things right, the girl sets off in search of the Little Prince. Escaping out through her bedroom window to go to the aviator\'s yard, the girl, accompanied by her now-conscious stuffed fox.  The Little Prince\'s story pages, flies the aviator\'s now-fixed plane into space. They find all the stars mysteriously gone, all the while landing on an asteroid populated by workaholic adults owned by the Businessman from the Little Prince\'s story, who captures and holds all the stars to power his asteroid and belongings (including his employees). After encountering a police officer and an elevator operator who were the Conceited man and the King from the story.  they finally find the Little Prince, who has become an anxious, incompetent adult renamed ""Mr. Prince"" and works as a janitor for the Businessman, having no recollection or memory of his past.', 'Mr. Prince accordingly takes the girl to an ""academy"" where she is to be ""reconditioned"" as an adult via a machine controlled by a tall, sinister Teacher. Recognising the drawing of his sheep\'s box from the aviator\'s pages, which he still keeps the original despite his amnesia, believing it could be important, Mr. Prince begins to regain his memories and saves the girl from the same fate that he had by putting the Teacher in the machine instead.', 'They escape from the Businessman together and liberate all of the stars from his glass vault, which return to their rightful place in the sky. The girl and the fox then take Mr. Prince back to B-612, which is overgrown with dead, withered baobabs. They find the Rose dead, but seeing her image in the sunrise, the baobabs disappear and Mr. Prince turns back to his younger self, giving him renewed hope.', 'The girl and the fox (once again an inanimate toy) return home, accompanied by another flock of birds. The next morning, the girl and her mother visit the aviator in the hospital. The girl apologises and presents him with the formerly loose pages bound together as a book, along with all the formerly missing parts filled in. The girl subsequently begins her studies at Werth Academy and reconciles with her mother. Both of them happily stargaze one night, while the Little Prince and the aviator are heard laughing joyfully together on Asteroid B-612.']]"

Before moving in officially, he meets the concierge, who shows the apartment to him, and also shows him where Simone fell. He visits Simone in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Simone's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella, who has also come to visit. Stella is overwhelmed with emotion and begins talking to Simone, who looks towards her visitors and screams monstrously. The matron insists they leave, having already informed Trelkovsky that he may not speak to Choule. Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where Stella fondles him. "", 'Outside the theatre they part ways. Later, Trelkovsky calls up the hospital to enquire about Simone, and is told she has died.', 'As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised repeatedly by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy, for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He discusses this with his friends, who do not find things strange and belittle him for not standing up to his neighbours. He visits the apartment of one of his work friends, who plays a marching band record at a spitefully loud volume. A neighbour politely asks him to turn down the music, as his wife is ill and trying to sleep. Trelkovsky turns the record down, but his friend tells the neighbour that he will play his music as he wants, and that he does not care about his sick wife.', ""He receives a visit from one Georges Badar, who secretly loved Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. He receives a postcard that Badar had posted before realising Simone had died. Frequenting the nearby café which Simone also patronised, he is recognized as the new tenant of her apartment. The owner pressures him into having Simone's regular order, which is then always given to him without being ordered, against his preferences. They are always out of his preferred choice of cigarette, Gauloises, so he develops a habit of ordering Marlboros, which Simone used to order. Nobody has any idea why Simone was suicidal."", ""Trelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge continue to berate him for making too much noise, and his landlord warns him not to inform the police of the burglary. Suffering from fever and bad dreams, he wakes up one morning to find his face made up. He buys a wig and women's shoes and goes on to dress up (using Simone's dress which he had found in a cupboard) and sit still in his apartment in the dead of night. He suspects that Zy and neighbors are trying to subtly change him into the last tenant, Simone, so that he too will kill himself. He becomes hostile and paranoid in his day-to-day environment (snapping at his friends, slapping a child in a park) and his mental state progressively deteriorates. He has visions of his neighbors playing football with a human head, finds the toilet covered in hieroglyphs, and looking across the courtyard, sees himself standing at his apartment window, looking into the bathroom with binoculars. Trelkovsky runs off to Stella for comfort and sleeps over, but in the morning after she has left for work, he concludes that she too is in on his neighbors' plot, and proceeds to vandalise and burgle her apartment before departing."", 'At night he is hit by an elderly couple driving a car. He is not injured too seriously, but receives a sedative injection from the doctor due to his odd behavior – he perceives the elderly couple as his landlord Zy and wife, and accuses them of trying to murder him. The couple returns him to his apartment. A deranged Trelkovsky dresses up again as a woman and throws himself out of the apartment window in the manner of Simone Choule, before what he believes to be a clapping, cheering audience composed of his neighbors. The suicide attempt wakes up his neighbors, who call the police and attempt to restrain him. He crawls away from them back to his apartment, and jumps out the window a second time moments after the police arrive.', ""In the final scene, Trelkovsky is bandaged up in the same fashion as Simone Choule, in the same hospital bed.

Drummond grows frustrated, feeling the case has already been decided. When he asks to withdraw from the case, the judge holds Drummond in contempt of court, orders him jailed, and tells Drummond to show cause the next morning why he should not be held in contempt of court. John Stebbins offers his farm as collateral for Drummond's bail. Stebbins' son was a friend and protégé of Cates who drowned after developing a cramp while swimming.

Brady's confidence in his Biblical knowledge is so great that he welcomes this challenge, but becomes flustered under Drummond's cross-examination, unable to explain certain Biblical events, until he is forced to confess that at least some Biblical passages cannot be interpreted literally. Drummond hammers home his point —  that Cates, like any other man, demands the right to think for himself, and those citing divine support as a rationale to silence him are wrong."", 'The jury finds Cates guilty, but, the judge, concerned with political embarrassment, fines him only $100 ($1,476 in current dollars). Brady is furious and tries to enter a speech into the record, but Drummond persuades the judge to disallow it as the trial has concluded. As court adjourns, Brady tries to give his speech but most ignore him outside of his wife and his opponents at the defense table — Cates, Rachel, Hornbeck, and Drummond. As he becomes increasingly hysterical, he suffers a ""busted belly"" and dies.', 'After the crowd has cleared out, Hornbeck talks with Drummond, wanting to use the Bible quotation from Brown\'s rally, where Brady had quoted the ""inherit the wind"" verse because Rev. Brown was about to damn his own daughter to hell. Drummond quotes the verse verbatim, shocking Hornbeck, who states, ""Well, we\'re growing an odd crop of agnostics this year!"" They argue over Brady\'s legacy, Drummond accuses Hornbeck of being a heartless cynic, and Hornbeck walks out, leaving Drummond alone in the courtroom.

She is rescued but – instead of going back with Sebastian – Ernst commits suicide by walking out into the uncleared area."", 'Rasmussen relents in his treatment of the boys and reassures a grieving Sebastian that they will soon be able to go home. While four of the boys continue to clear the beach, a mine that was not properly defused is accidentally tossed onto a truckload of deactivated mines, setting off a massive chain reaction and killing the other seven. Only Sebastian, Ludwig, Helmut and Rodolf remain.', ""Although the boys had been promised that they would be sent home after defusing all of the mines, without Rasmussen's knowledge Jensen sends the surviving four to join a team defusing landmines without the aid of a map in another coastal area.

Eisenstein divided the plot into five acts, each with its own title:"", 'The scene begins with two sailors, Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk, discussing the need for the crew of the Potemkin, anchored off the island of Tendra, to support the revolution taking place within Russia. After their watch, they and other off-duty sailors are sleeping in their hammocks. As an officer inspects the quarters, he stumbles and takes out his aggression on a sleeping sailor. The ruckus causes Vakulinchuk to awake, and he gives a speech to the men as they come to. Vakulinchuk says, ""Comrades! The time has come when we too must speak out. Why wait? All of Russia has risen! Are we to be the last?"" The scene cuts to morning above deck, where sailors are remarking on the poor quality of the meat for the crew. The meat appears to be rotten and covered in worms, and the sailors say that ""even a dog wouldn\'t eat this!"" The ship\'s doctor, Smirnov, is called over to inspect the meat by the captain. Rather than worms, the doctor says that the insects are maggots, and they can be washed off before cooking. The sailors further complain about the poor quality of the rations, but the doctor declares the meat edible and ends the discussion. Senior officer Giliarovsky forces the sailors still looking over the rotten meat to leave the area, and the cook begins to prepare borscht although he too questions the quality of the meat. The crew refuses to eat the borscht, instead choosing bread and water, and canned goods. While cleaning dishes, one of the sailors sees an inscription on a plate which reads ""give us this day our daily bread"". After considering the meaning of this phrase, the sailor smashes the plate and the scene ends.', ""All those who refuse the meat are judged guilty of insubordination and are brought to the fore-deck where they receive religious last rites. The sailors are obliged to kneel and a canvas cover is thrown over them as a firing squad marches onto the deck. The First Officer gives the order to fire, but in response to Vakulinchuk's pleas the sailors in the firing squad lower their rifles and the uprising begins. The sailors overwhelm the outnumbered officers and take control of the ship. The officers are thrown overboard, the ship's priest is dragged out of hiding, and finally the doctor is thrown into the ocean as 'food for the worms'. The mutiny is successful but Vakulinchuk, the charismatic leader of the rebels, is killed."", 'The Potemkin arrives at the port of Odessa.

The citizens of Odessa, saddened yet empowered by Vakulinchuk\'s sacrifice, are soon whipped into a frenzy against the Tsar and his government by sympathizers. A man allied with the government tries to turn the citizens\' fury against the Jews, but he is quickly shouted down and beaten by the people. The sailors gather to make a final farewell and praise Vakulinchuk as a hero. The people of Odessa welcome the sailors, but they attract the police as they mobilize against the government.', ""The citizenry of Odessa take to their ships and boats, sailing out to the Potemkin to show their support to the sailors and donate supplies, while a crowd of others gather at the Odessa steps to witness the happenings and cheer on the rebels. Suddenly a detachment of dismounted Cossacks form battle lines at the top of the steps and march toward a crowd of unarmed civilians including women and children, and begin firing and advancing with fixed bayonets. Every now and again, the soldiers halt to fire a volley into the crowd before continuing their impersonal, machine-like assault down the stairs, ignoring the people's pleas for humanity and understanding. Meanwhile, government cavalry attack the fleeing crowd at the bottom of the steps as well, cutting down many of those who survived the dismounted assault. Brief sequences show individuals among the people fleeing or falling, a baby carriage rolling down the steps, a woman shot in the face, broken glasses, and the high boots of the soldiers moving in unison."", 'In retaliation, the sailors of the Potemkin use the guns of the battleship to fire on the city opera house, where Tsarist military leaders are convening a meeting. Meanwhile, there is news that a squadron of loyal warships is coming to quell the revolt of the Potemkin.', 'The sailors of the Potemkin decide to take the battleship out from the port of Odessa to face the fleet of the Tsar. Just when battle seems inevitable, the sailors of the Tsarist squadron refuse to open fire, cheering and shouting to show solidarity with the mutineers and allowing the Potemkin, flying the red flag, to pass between their ships.']]"

In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a ""contest"" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina.

Running away, the Tramp stumbles into the middle of a performance and unknowingly becomes the hit of the show."", 'The ringmaster/proprietor of the struggling circus gives him a tryout the next day, but the Tramp fails miserably. However, when the property men quit because they have not been paid, he gets hired on the spot to take their place. Once again, he inadvertently creates comic mayhem during a show. The ringmaster craftily hires him as a poorly paid property man who is always stationed in the performance area of the big top tent so he can unknowingly improvise comic material.', 'The Tramp befriends Merna (Kennedy), a horse rider who is treated badly by her ringmaster stepfather. She later informs the Tramp that he is the star of the show, forcing the ringmaster to pay him accordingly. With the circus thriving because of him, the Tramp also is able to secure better treatment for Merna.', 'After overhearing a fortune teller inform Merna that she sees ""love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now"", the overjoyed Tramp buys a ring from another clown. Alas for him, she meets Rex (Crocker), the newly hired tightrope walker. The Tramp eavesdrops as she rushes to tell the fortune teller that she has fallen in love with the new man. With his heart broken, the Tramp is unable to entertain the crowds. After several poor performances, the ringmaster warns him he has only one more chance.', 'When Rex cannot be found for a performance, the ringmaster (knowing that the Tramp has been practicing the tightrope act in hopes of supplanting his rival) sends the Tramp out in his place.

However, when he sees the ringmaster slapping Merna around afterward, he beats the man and is fired.', 'Merna runs away to join him. The Tramp finds and brings Rex back with him to marry Merna. The trio goes back to the circus. The ringmaster starts berating his stepdaughter, but stops when Rex informs him that she is his wife. When the traveling circus leaves, the Tramp remains behind: he prefers to fade to allow them to be happy. Melancholic, he picks himself up and starts walking jauntily away.']]"
