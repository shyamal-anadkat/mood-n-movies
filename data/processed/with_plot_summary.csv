Oskar Schindler, a German member of the Nazi Party from Czechoslovakia, arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. Schindler bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as ""Herr Direktor"".', ""SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth arrives in Kraków to oversee construction of the Płaszów concentration camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to Płaszów, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. Göth brutalizes his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp."", 'As the Germans begin losing the war, Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów to Auschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks Göth for permission to move his workers to a munitions factory he plans to build in Brünnlitz near his home town of Zwittau. Göth reluctantly agrees, but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create ""Schindler\'s List"" – a list of 850 people to be transferred to Brünnlitz instead of Auschwitz.', ""As the Jewish workers are transported by train to Brünnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss, commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Jewish Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders."", 'As a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler\'s factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them to ""return to [their] families as men, instead of murderers"". Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire"". Schindler is both touched and ashamed, feeling he should have done more. He breaks down in tears and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the Schindlerjuden awaken the next morning, a Soviet soldier announces that they have been liberated. The Jews then walk to a nearby town.', ""An epilogue reveals that Göth was executed via hanging, and Schindler had failed in both business and marriage following the war. In the present, many of the surviving Schindlerjuden and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker (the traditional Jewish sign of respect on visiting a grave), with Liam Neeson laying two roses.""]]",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/schindlers-list?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1c

Lecter, who considers this an ""unspeakably ugly"" act, calls Starling back and tells her to seek out his old patient. This leads her to a storage facility, where she discovers a jar containing a man\'s severed head. She returns to Lecter, who says the man is linked to Buffalo Bill.

Anticipating the market's collapse in the second quarter of 2007, as interest rates would rise from adjustable-rate mortgages, he proposes to create a credit default swap market, allowing him to bet against, or short, market-based mortgage-backed securities, for profit."", 'His long-term bet, exceeding $1 billion, is accepted by major investment and commercial banks but requires paying substantial monthly premiums. This sparks his main client, Lawrence Fields, to accuse him of ""wasting"" capital while many clients demand that he reverse and sell, but Burry refuses. Under pressure, he eventually restricts withdrawals, angering investors, and Fields sues Burry. Eventually, the market collapses and his fund\'s value increases by 489% with an overall profit (even allowing for the massive premiums) of over $2.69 billion, with Fields receiving $489 million alone.', ""Jared Vennett (based on Greg Lippmann),[8] the executive in charge of global asset-backed securities trading at Deutsche Bank,[9] is one of the first to understand Burry's analysis, learning from one of the bankers who sold Burry an early credit default swap. Using his quant to verify that Burry is most likely correct, he decides to enter the market, earning a fee from selling the swaps to firms who will profit when the underlying bonds fail. A misplaced phone call alerts FrontPoint Partners hedge fund manager Mark Baum (based on Steve Eisman), who is motivated to buy swaps from Vennett due to his low regard for banks' ethics and business models. Vennett explains that the packaging of subprime loans into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) rated at AAA ratings will guarantee their eventual collapse."", 'Conducting a field investigation in South Florida, the FrontPoint team discovers that mortgage brokers are profiting by selling their mortgage deals to Wall Street banks, who pay higher margins for the riskier mortgages, creating the bubble. This knowledge prompts the FrontPoint team to buy swaps from Vennett.', 'In early 2007, as these loans begin to default, CDO prices somehow rise and ratings agencies refuse to downgrade the bond ratings. Baum discovers conflicts of interest and dishonesty amongst the credit rating agencies from an acquaintance at Standard & Poor\'s. Vennett invites the team to the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas, where Baum learns from a CDO manager that the market for insuring mortgage bonds, including ""synthetic CDOs"" which are bets in favor of the faulty mortgage bonds, is significantly larger than the market for the mortgage loans themselves, leading a horrified Baum to realize the entire world economy is set to collapse.', 'As the subprime bonds continue to fall, Baum learns that Morgan Stanley, whose umbrella FrontPoint operates under, had also taken short positions against mortgage derivatives.

Now that these are also collapsing in value, Morgan Stanley is facing severe liquidity problems. Despite pressure from his staff to sell their position before Morgan Stanley collapses, Baum refuses to sell until the economy is on the verge of collapsing, making over $1 billion in their swaps.

Below the capital threshold for an ISDA Master Agreement required to enter into trades like Burry's and Baum's, they enlist the aid of Ben Rickert, a retired securities trader who was based in Singapore. When the bond values and CDOs rise despite defaults, Geller suspects the banks of committing fraud. The trio also visit the American Securitization Forum, where they learn that the SEC has no regulations to monitor mortgage-backed security activity.

Teddy encounters George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement, who claims that the doctors are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. Noyce warns that everyone else on the island, including Chuck, is playing an elaborate game designed around Teddy.', ""Teddy regroups with Chuck and climbs the cliffs toward the lighthouse. They become separated, and Teddy later sees what he believes to be Chuck's body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down, the body is revealed to be an optical illusion of the rocks, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding, who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at Ashecliffe who discovered the experiments with psychotropic medication and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop mind control techniques. Before Solando could report her findings to the authorities, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe. She insists that Ashecliffe is attempting to create shells of human beings so psychotic they will be completely comfortable in committing absolutely insane atrocities against society.  When Teddy reveals his past experience with trauma, she insists that the hospital will use Teddy’s experiences to feign a psychotic break, allowing them to also trap him through forced commitment to the hospital. Solando notices Teddy’s injured head, and asks if he’s been having strange dreams or headaches. He confirms that he has, and a suddenly-panicked Solando reveals that it’s likely that Teddy has likely been fed neuroleptic narcotics through the pill he was offered during his migraine, as well as the food, coffee and cigarettes at the facility. She explains that the narcotics manifest firstly as palsy, beginning as a restriction of use in the fingers and hands, which Teddy has begun to experience. Teddy diverts the conversation to the lighthouse, which is apparently where experimental neurosurgeries take place. "", 'Teddy returns to the hospital and is greeted by Dr. Cawley. When Teddy enquires to Cawley about Chuck’s whereabouts, Cawley firmly insists that Teddy does not have a partner, that he arrived on the island alone. Teddy submits, pretending to agree that he has no partner to remove suspicion. ', 'Convinced Chuck was taken to the lighthouse, Teddy steals a set of keys from a guard. He tries to flee to the lighthouse with them, but runs into Dr. Naehring, who attempts to stab him with a sedative-loaded syringe. Teddy overpowers Naehring, stabbing him with the syringe and sedating him. While hiding from staff on his way to the lighthouse, Teddy discovers a car. As his hallucinations worsen, he dips the tie his wife bought him in the cars gas tank, fashioning it as a wick and lighting it up, causing the car to explode into flames and distract the staff. ', 'Teddy breaks into the lighthouse, only to discover Dr. Cawley smugly waiting for him, telling him that his gun isn’t loaded. Teddy shakily confronts Cawley and reveals his encounter with Solando, confirming he knows that Cawley drugged him. Cawley denies that Solando ever existed and insists that Teddy has not been fed narcotics, explaining the tremors as being withdrawals from Chlorpromazine, an anti-psychotic medication that he has been taking for the “last 24 months”. Teddy rejects Cawley’s insistence that he is and has been a patient of the hospital for the last 2 years. Cawley explains that Teddy is actually Andrew Laeddis, Cawley continues confronting Teddy as their ""most dangerous patient"", incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his manic depressive wife, Dolores, after she drowned their three children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are anagrams of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal, and the little girl from Laeddis\'s recurring dreams is his daughter, Rachel. Cawley also discloses that Andrew attacked Noyce two weeks earlier for calling him Laeddis. Teddy\'s denial comes from his guilt over not having sought mental help for his wife after she burned down their city apartment. After the arson, the whole family went to the lake house, where Dolores drowned their children some time later.  According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to cure Andrew\'s conspiracy-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Teddy Daniels. The hospital staff were part of the test, including Lester Sheehan posing as Chuck and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. Andrew\'s migraines were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were his hallucinations of the ""real Rachel Solando"". Overwhelmed by the memories of what really happened, Andrew faints.', ""He awakens in the hospital under the watch of Cawley, Sheehan, the warden and the nurse who played Rachel Solando. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, satisfying the doctors. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but Andrew quickly regressed. He warns this will be Andrew's last chance; otherwise, they will have to lobotomize him."", 'Some time later, Andrew relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan, but calls him ""Chuck"" again, saying they must leave the island. Sheehan shakes his head to Cawley, upon which Cawley speaks to Naehring and the warden before turning away. The warden gestures to the orderlies and Andrew is taken away to be lobotomized. Before leaving peacefully, Andrew asks Sheehan if it would be worse ""to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?""

The verdict must be unanimous.', ""At first, the evidence seems convincing: a neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window and through the windows of a passing elevated train. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father and the father's body hitting the ground, and then, as he opened his door, saw the defendant running down the stairs.

Juror 8 reasons that the witness, who was trying to sleep when she saw the killing, was not wearing her eyeglasses when it happened and she would not have had time to put them on to get a clear view of the person who did the stabbing, making her story dubious.

As Truman was selected from birth following an unwanted pregnancy, Christof claims that Truman came to be adopted not just by the show, but by the ""world"". Truman\'s hometown of Seahaven Island is a complete set built within an enormous dome, populated by crew members and actors who highlight the product placements that generate revenue for the show. The elaborate set allows Christof to control almost every aspect of Truman\'s life, including the weather. To prevent Truman from discovering his false reality, Christof manufactures scenarios that dissuade Truman\'s desire for exploration, such as the ""death"" of his father in a sea storm to instill aquaphobia, and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling and the virtues of staying home. However, Christof cannot predict all of Truman\'s actions. During his college years, Truman was intended to fall in love with and marry co-student Meryl, but fell for Sylvia, an extra. Although Sylvia was quickly removed from the show before she could disclose its nature to Truman, he continues to remember her, and secretly dreams of a life with Sylvia outside of his marriage to Meryl. To this end, he seeks to travel to Fiji, where he was told Sylvia\'s family moved. In the real world, Sylvia is a part of the ""Free Truman"" campaign, which fights to have Truman released from the program.', ""As the show approaches its 30th anniversary, Truman begins discovering unusual elements such as a spotlight falling out of the sky in front of his house and a radio channel that precisely describes his movements. These events are punctuated by the reappearance of his father, who had infiltrated the set as a beggar. Truman begins questioning his life and realizes that the city somehow revolves around him. Meryl's stress from attempting to uphold the charade in the face of Truman's growing skepticism and hostility causes their marriage to deteriorate. One day, Truman takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but increasingly implausible emergencies block their way. During an argument ignited by Meryl attempting to advertise a product, Truman determines that Meryl is a part of the conspiracy and holds her at knife-point; she breaks character and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof re-introduces Truman's father to the show properly, under the guise of having lost his memory after the boating accident. This helps the show regain the ratings lead with audiences, and Truman seems to return to his routines, except he begins sleeping in his basement. One night, Truman secretly disappears through a makeshift tunnel in his basement, forcing Christof to temporarily suspend the broadcast for the first time in its history. Audiences around the world are captivated by this unexpected event, and tune in record numbers."", 'Christof orders a citywide search for Truman and is soon forced to ""cue the sun"" and break the production\'s day-night cycle to optimize the search.

As Truman contemplates leaving his world, Christof speaks directly to Truman through a speaker system and tries to persuade him to stay, claiming that there is no more truth in the real world than in his artificial one, where he would have nothing to fear. After a moment of reflection, Truman says his catchphrase: ""In case I don\'t see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night"", bows to his audience and exits. The viewers celebrate his escape, and Sylvia races to greet him. Defeated, Christof\'s supervisors finally end the program on a shot of the open exit door.

While returning home, Jack admits to Bobby that it was him he idolised and not their father.

Later, Rez arrives at their home to await Ally; while waiting, Rez confronts Jack and accuses him of nearly ruining Ally's career and stating that Jack will certainly relapse again. That evening, Ally lies to Jack and tells him that her record label has canceled her tour so she can focus on her second album. Jack promises that he will come to her concert that night, but after Ally leaves, he hangs himself in their garage. Ally, grief-stricken and inconsolable after Jack's suicide, is visited by Bobby, who tells her that the suicide was Jack's own fault and not hers.

The genus name signified ""bear-rat"".[16][17] The European marmot is of the same genus and was formerly called Arctomys alpinus. It was speculated that the European counterpart might have lore similar to the groundhog attached to it.[16][d]', 'The German version, with the introduction of the badger (or other beasts) was an expansion on a more simple tradition that if the weather was sunny and clear on Candlemas Day people expected winter to continue.[8] The simpler version is summarized in the English (Scots dialect) couplet that runs ""If Candlemas is fair and clear / There\'ll be twa winters in the year"",[e][f] with equivalent phrases in French and German.[19] And the existence of a corresponding Latin couplet has been suggested as evidence of the great antiquity of this tradition.[g][19]', ""The use of candles on the Christian Candlemas was inspired by the Roman rite for the goddess Februa, in which a procession of candles was done on February 2, according to Yoder. The Roman calendar, in turn, had Celtic origins. Candlemas concurs with Imbolc, one of the Celtic 'cross-quarter days', the four days which marked the midpoints between solstice and equinox.[21][20]"", 'Scholar Rhys Carpenter in 1946 emphasized that the Badger Day tradition was strong in Germany, but absent in the British Isles, and he referred to this as a reason that the U.S. Groundhog Day was not brought by immigrants from these places.[22]', ""There did exist a belief among Roman Catholics in Britain that the hedgehog predicted the length of winter, or so it has been claimed, but without demonstration of its age, in a publication by the Scotland-born American journalist Thomas C.

The lodge members were the ""genesis"" of the Groundhog Club formed later, which continued the Groundhog Day tradition. But the lodge started out being interested in the groundhog as a game animal for food. It had started to serve groundhog at the lodge, and had been organizing a hunting party on a day each year in late summer.[34]', 'The chronologies given are somewhat inconsistent in the literature.

A drink called the ""groundhog punch"" was also served.[o][37][38] The flavor has been described as a ""cross between pork and chicken"".[39] The hunt and feast did not attract enough outside interest, and the practice discontinued.[35]', 'The groundhog was not named Phil until 1961, possibly as an indirect reference to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[40]', 'The largest Groundhog Day celebration is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where crowds as large as 40,000 gather each year[41] (nearly eight times the year-round population of the town).[42] The average draw had been about 2,000 until the 1993 film Groundhog Day, which is set at the festivities in Punxsutawney, after which attendance rose to about 10,000.[35] The official Phil is pretended to be a supercentenarian, having been the same forecasting beast since 1887.[35]', 'In 2019, the 133rd year of the tradition, the groundhog was summoned to come out at 7:25\xa0am on February 2, but did not see its shadow.[43] Fans of Punxsutawney Phil awaited his arrival starting at 6:00\xa0am, thanks to a live stream provided by Visit Pennsylvania. The live stream has been a tradition for the past several years, allowing more people than ever to watch the animal meteorologist.[44]', '2021 was the 135th, and for the first time, much of the Inner Circle members were required to wear a mask. The groundhog was summoned at 7:25\xa0am on February 2 and saw its shadow.[45] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceremony was held behind closed doors, with no fans allowed to attend.', '2022 saw the 136th time of the event and the groundhog saw its shadow, predicting six more weeks of winter.[46]']]",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/groundhog-day?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1c

Reuben's familiarity with casino security makes him very reluctant to get involved, but when he starts to think of it as a good way to get back at his rival, Terry Benedict, who owns all three casinos, he agrees to finance the operation. The three men know that the Nevada Gaming Commission requires casinos to have enough cash on hand to cover all their patrons' bets and they predict that on the upcoming night of a highly anticipated boxing match, the Bellagio vault will contain more than $150,000,000."", 'Danny and Rusty recruit eight former colleagues and criminal specialists: Linus Caldwell, a young and talented pickpocket; Frank Catton, a discredited casino dealer and con man; Virgil and Turk Malloy, a pair of gifted mechanics; Livingston Dell, an electronics and surveillance expert; Basher Tarr, an explosives expert; Saul Bloom, an elderly con man; and ""The Amazing"" Yen, an accomplished acrobat. Several team members carry out reconnaissance at the Bellagio to learn as much as possible about the security, the routines, the behaviors of the casino staff, and the building itself. Other members create a precise replica of the vault, which is built in order to practice maneuvering through its formidable security systems. During this planning phase, the team discovers that Danny\'s ex-wife, Tess, is Benedict\'s girlfriend. Rusty urges Danny to give up on the plan, believing Danny incapable of sound judgment while Tess is involved, but Danny refuses.', ""On the night of the fight, the plan is put into motion.

Benedict studies the video footage and recognizes that the flooring in the vault on the video lacks the Bellagio logo, which had been added only recently to the vault. It is shown that Danny's team used their practice vault to create fake footage to fool Benedict. Furthermore, they themselves were the SWAT team and used their gear bags to take all of the money from the vault right under Benedict's nose. Benedict goes to see that Danny has seemingly been locked up in the storeroom throughout the heist and thus innocent of any involvement. As Tess watches via CCTV, Danny tricks Benedict into saying he would give her up in exchange for the money. Benedict, dissatisfied with Danny's plan to get back the money, orders his men to escort Danny off the premises and inform the police that he is violating his parole by being in Las Vegas. Tess leaves Benedict and exits the hotel just in time to see Danny arrested.

He proclaims he has committed the perfect bank robbery. In New York, masked robbers, dressed in painter coveralls and using variants of the name ""Steve"" as aliases, seize control of a Manhattan bank, taking patrons and employees hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms, forcing them to don coveralls identical to their own. The robbers rotate the hostages among various rooms and occasionally insert themselves covertly into the groups. They also take turns working on an unspecified project involving demolishing the floor in one of the bank\'s storage rooms.', 'Police surround the bank, and Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell take charge of the negotiations. Russell, the head robber demands food be provided. The police send pizzas whose boxes have hidden listening devices. The bugs pick up someone speaking Albanian, which is later identified as propaganda recordings of deceased Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, implying that the robbers anticipated the attempted surveillance.', 'When Arthur Case, chairman of the board of directors and the bank founder, learns about the in-progress robbery, he hires ""fixer"" Madeleine White to try and protect the contents of his safe deposit box within the bank. Russell allows White to enter the bank and inspect the box\'s contents, which include documents from Nazi Germany. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in many Jews dying during World War II. White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum if he destroys the box\'s contents.', 'Frazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell takes him on a tour of the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another robber. Afterwards, he explains that he deliberately provoked Russell, and concludes he is not a killer. However, this is seemingly disproven when the robbers stage a hostage execution.', ""The execution prompts an Emergency Services Unit team into action. They plan to storm the bank, using rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades, remove their disguises, and exit the bank with the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props showing that the hostage execution was faked, and no money or valuables appear to have been stolen. With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case."", ""Frazier, however, searches the bank's records and finds that safe deposit box number 392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. He is then confronted by White, who informs him of Case's Nazi dealings. She attempts to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording he had surreptitiously made of an incriminating conversation that took place earlier between the two. White confronts Case, who admits the box contained loose diamonds and a diamond ring he took from a Jewish friend whom he betrayed to the Nazis."", 'Russell repeats his opening monologue while hiding behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the bank\'s supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case\'s safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. He exits the bank and enters a waiting van filled with his conspirators, some of whom had been questioned by the police.  When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell reading, ""follow the ring."" Frazier confronts Case and urges White to contact the Office of War Crimes Issues at the State Department about Case\'s war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond and realizes that Russell slipped the diamond into his pocket during their ""collision"" as Russell exited the bank.']]",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-man?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1c

The young priest Father Vogler approaches Salieri for elaboration on Salieri's confession. Salieri recounts how, even in his youth in the 1760s, he desired to be a composer, much to his father's chagrin. He prays to God that if He makes Salieri a famous composer, he will, in return, promise his faithfulness. Soon after, his father dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. By 1774, Salieri has become court composer to Emperor Joseph II in Vienna. Seven years later, at a reception in honor of Mozart's patron, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Salieri is shocked to discover that the transcendentally talented Mozart is obscene and immature. Salieri, a devout Catholic, cannot fathom why God would endow such a great gift to Mozart instead of him and concludes that God is using Mozart's talent to mock Salieri's mediocrity. Salieri renounces God and vows to take revenge on Him by destroying Mozart."", ""Mozart's alcoholism deteriorates his health, marriage, and reputation at court, even as he continues to produce brilliant work. Salieri hires a young girl to pose as Mozart's maid and discovers that Mozart is working on an opera based on the play The Marriage of Figaro, which the Emperor has forbidden. When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow his opera to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisers' attempts at sabotage. When Mozart is informed that his father has died, he writes Don Giovanni in his grief. Salieri recognizes the dead commander in the opera as symbolic of Mozart's father and concocts a scheme; he leads Mozart to believe that his father has risen to commission a Requiem. He then plans to kill Mozart once the piece is finished and premiere it at Mozart's funeral, claiming the work as his own. Meanwhile, Mozart's friend Emanuel Schikaneder invites him to write an opera for his theatre. Mozart obliges despite his wife Constanze's insistence that he finish the Requiem. After arguing with Mozart, Constanze leaves with their young son, Karl."", ""Mozart's new opera, The Magic Flute, is a great success, but the overworked Mozart collapses during one performance. Salieri takes him home and persuades him to continue the Requiem, offering to take the bedridden Mozart's dictation. The next morning, Mozart thanks Salieri for his friendship, and Salieri admits that Mozart is the greatest composer he knows. Constanze returns and demands that Salieri leave immediately. In her guilt, she locks the unfinished Requiem, keeping it away from Salieri, and Mozart dies from exhaustion. Mozart is taken out of the city and unceremoniously buried in a mass grave during a rainstorm. "", 'Back in 1823, Vogler is too shocked to absolve Salieri, who surmises that the ""merciful"" God preferred to destroy His beloved Mozart rather than allow Salieri to share in the smallest part of His glory. Salieri promises, with bitter irony, to both pray for and absolve Vogler along with all of the world\'s mediocrities as their ""patron saint"". As Salieri is wheeled down a hallway, absolving the hospital\'s patients of their own inadequacies as he passes by, Mozart\'s laughter rings in the air.']]","[<a class=""external text"" href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/"" rel=""nofollow""><i>Amadeus</i></a>]"

By 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF), a global military alliance established to combat the alien threat, finally achieves a victory over the Mimics at Verdun using newly developed mech-suits. In Britain, the UDF plans a major invasion of France, and General Brigham orders recently attached U.S. Army Major William Cage, a public affairs officer, to cover it. Cage, having no combat experience, objects and threatens to blame Brigham if the invasion fails. Brigham has Cage arrested and sent to Heathrow Airport, now a military base. Cage awakens to find Brigham has demoted him to a private and assigned him to Master Sergeant Farell and the misfit J-Squad, who do not take kindly to Cage.', ""The landing in France is a colossal failure; Farell and J-Squad are quickly killed.

His attempts to warn Farell against the invasion are ignored, and he experiences the loop of dying on the beach and waking up at Heathrow repeatedly.

She realizes Cage can loop time and orders him to find her the next time he wakes up."", 'Cage reawakens and locates Vrataski, who takes him to Dr. Carter, an expert in Mimic biology. He explains that the Mimics are a superorganism in which the ""Omega"" controls the cerebrum, while the ""Alphas"" behave as the ganglia through which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics; if an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and adjusts its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently ""hijacked"" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alpha\'s blood. Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before she was wounded and received a blood transfusion, losing the power. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega to end the alien invasion.', 'Over many more loops, Vrataski trains Cage to excel in combat. After a frustrating lesson, Cage escapes to London, only to discover that the Mimics will attack there next after the invasion. After seeing visions of a dam in Germany where the Omega is hiding and spending many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam, Cage grows closer to Vrataski, but she is only interested in the mission. Cage flies to the dam alone upon reaching a point where Vrataski is killed no matter what they do. The Omega is not there and he is ambushed by an Alpha who attempts to strip him of his ability to reset time, but Cage deliberately drowns himself.', ""Cage and Vrataski infiltrate the Ministry of Defence, where Cage convinces Brigham to give him Carter's prototype device that can locate the Omega, but they are pursued by military police on leaving. During the ensuing car chase, Cage uses the device and discovers the Omega is under the Louvre Pyramid in Paris. Cage is seriously injured during capture and wakes up in a hospital to find he has been given a blood transfusion and has lost the ability to loop time."", 'Vrataski frees Cage and they recruit J-Squad to help destroy the Omega before the invasion begins. They fly to Paris, where the soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski can reach the Louvre. Before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to thank him for getting her as far as he did. When the Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, he manages to drop a belt of grenades that destroys the Omega, killing the Alpha and the Mimics.', ""As a dying Cage floats down into the Omega's blood, he loops again, and awakens two days earlier, en route to his original meeting with Brigham, before the UDF invasion of France. But this time he awakens in an alternative history. In this alternative timeline, he watches a news conference during which the General announces that a huge mysterious energy blast was detected in Paris. The General says that the Mimics have died and the human forces will commence sweeping through Europe the next day. When he arrives he sees that all of J-Squad are alive.

One model of car with these features is the similar-looking 1963 Pontiac Tempest.   Because both Buick and Pontiac are owned by GM, the Pontiac Tempest was also available in metallic mint-green.

In response to this mass influx, the UK has become a police state as the British Army arrests, imprisons or executes illegal immigrants. ', ""Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrant-rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee. He obtains the papers from his cousin, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art, and agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a larger sum of money. Luke, a Fishes member, drives Theo, Kee, Julian, and former midwife Miriam towards Canterbury, but an armed gang ambushes them, and Julian is killed. Afterwards, two police officers stop their car, but Luke kills them, and the group hides Julian's body before heading to a Fishes safehouse."", ""While there, Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, making her the only pregnant woman on Earth, and that Julian had intended to hand her to the Human Project, a secretive scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing humanity's infertility. However, Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is voted as the new leader of the Fishes. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a discussion and learns that Julian's death was orchestrated by the Fishes so that Luke could become their leader, and that they intend to kill Theo and use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution. Theo wakes Kee and Miriam, and they steal a car, escaping to the secluded hideaway of Theo's aging friend Jasper Palmer, a former political cartoonist turned pot dealer."", ""The group makes plans to board the Human Project ship, the Tomorrow, which will arrive offshore at Bexhill-on-Sea disguised as a fishing vessel, and Jasper proposes having Syd, an immigration cop to whom he frequently sells drugs, smuggle them into Bexhill as refugees.

While investigating Crow's death, Witwer learns that two attempts were made on Lively's life; the first was thwarted by Precrime, but the second one succeeded a few minutes later.

Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson advocates that Santiago be transferred; however, Base Commander Colonel Nathan Jessup orders Santiago\'s platoon commander, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick, to ""train"" Santiago. Santiago dies shortly afterwards. Marines Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are accused of his murder and face a court-martial.', 'While it is believed that the motive in Santiago\'s murder was retribution for naming Dawson in a fenceline shooting, Naval investigator and lawyer Joanne Galloway suspects Dawson and Downey carried out a ""code red"" order: a violent extrajudicial punishment. Galloway wants to defend them, but the case is given to lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, a callow lawyer with a penchant for plea bargains. Galloway is bothered by Kaffee\'s blase approach, and Kaffee resents Galloway\'s interference.', 'Kaffee and Galloway question Colonel Jessup and others at Guantanamo Bay. Under questioning, Jessup claims Santiago was set to be transferred the next day. When Kaffee negotiates a plea bargain with the prosecutor Captain Jack Ross, Dawson and Downey refuse, insisting that Kendrick gave them the ""code red"" order and that they never intended Santiago to die. Dawson sees Kaffee as dishonorable by pursuing a plea bargain over defending their actions. Kaffee plans to have himself removed as counsel as he sees the trial as pointless. At the arraignment, Kaffee unexpectedly enters a plea of not guilty. He explains to Galloway that he was chosen to handle the case because he was expected to accept a plea, and the matter would be kept quiet.', 'Markinson meets Kaffee in secret and says that Jessup never ordered a transfer for Santiago. The defense establishes that Dawson had been denied promotion for smuggling food to a Marine who had been sentenced to go without food, painting Dawson in a good light and proving ""code reds"" had been ordered before. However, Downey, under cross-examination, reveals he was not actually present when Dawson received the supposed ""code red"" order. Markinson, ashamed that he failed to protect a Marine under his command, commits suicide before he can testify.', ""Without Markinson's testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost. He returns home in a drunken stupor, lamenting that he fought the case instead of taking a deal. Galloway encourages Kaffee to call Jessup as a witness, despite the risk of being court-martialed for smearing a high-ranking officer. "", 'Jessup spars with Kaffee\'s questioning, but is unnerved when Kaffee points out a contradiction in his testimony: Jessup stated his Marines never disobey orders and that Santiago was to be transferred for his own safety. Kaffee asks why Santiago was in danger if Jessup ordered his men to leave him alone. Disgusted by what he sees as Kaffee\'s impudence towards the Marines, Jessup extols the military\'s importance, and his own, to national security. Finally, Jessup bellows with contempt that he ordered the ""code red"". Jessup tries to leave the courtroom but is arrested.', 'Dawson and Downey are cleared of the murder and conspiracy charges, but found guilty of ""conduct unbecoming"" and will be dishonorably discharged.  Downey does not understand what they did wrong; Dawson explains that they had failed to defend those too weak to fight for themselves, like Santiago.  Kaffee tells Dawson that he does not need to wear a patch on his arm to have honor. Dawson sheds his previous contempt for Kaffee, acknowledges him as an officer, and renders a salute.

As a heterosexual, he initially refuses to accept the diagnosis but remembers having unprotected sex with a prostitute who was an intravenous drug user a couple years prior. He is soon ostracized by family and friends who mistakenly assume he contracted AIDS from homosexual relations. He gets fired from his job, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks, who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half a placebo, as this is the only way they can determine if the drug is working.', 'Woodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him AZT. As soon as he begins taking it, he finds his health deteriorating (exacerbated by his cocaine use). When he returns to the hospital, he meets Rayon, a drug addicted, HIV-positive trans woman, to whom he is initially hostile. As his health worsens, he drives to a makeshift Mexican hospital to get more AZT. The facility is run by a Dr. Vass, who has had his American medical license revoked because aspects of his work with AIDS patients had violated US regulations. Vass tells Woodroof that the AZT is ""poisonous"" and ""kills every cell it comes into contact with"". He instead prescribes a cocktail of drugs and nutritional supplements centered on ddC and the protein peptide T, which are not yet approved in the US. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved. It occurs to him that he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. Since the drugs alone are not illegal, he is able to get them over the border by masquerading as a priest and swearing that they are for personal use. Meanwhile, Saks also begins to notice the negative effects of AZT, but is told by her supervisor, Dr. Sevard, that it cannot be discontinued.', 'Over the next year, Woodroof begins selling the drugs on the street, at gay nightclubs, and at discotheque bars. He comes back into contact with Rayon, with whom he reluctantly sets up business since she can bring in more customers. The pair establish the ""Dallas Buyers Club"", charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. He gradually begins to respect Rayon as a friend. When Woodroof has a heart attack caused by an overdose of recently acquired interferon, Sevard learns of the club and the alternative medication. He is angry that it is interrupting his trial. The FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Saks agrees that there are benefits to AIDS medicine buyers clubs (of which there are several around the country) but feels powerless to change anything. The processes that the FDA uses to research, test and approve drugs are seen as flawed and a part of the problem for AIDS patients. Saks and Woodroof strike up a friendship.', 'The FDA gets a warrant to raid the Buyers Club, but can ultimately do nothing beyond fining Woodroof. In 1987, the FDA changes its regulations, making any unapproved drug illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon has died after being taken to the hospital. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she has been linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug ineffective. She refuses, and insists that she will have to be fired instead.', ""As time passes, Woodroof shows more compassion towards gay, lesbian, and transgender members of the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is the provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in late 1987 he files a lawsuit against the FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is sympathetic toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the power to do anything. As the film ends, the on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of the disease's effects in 1992, 7 years later than his doctors initially predicted.""]]",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dallas-buyers-club?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1c

Although Hawkeye is told he may leave in peace for his bravery, he offers to take Cora's place. Heyward, who is acting as interpreter, instead tells the Hurons to take his life for Cora's.

He hides his homosexuality and his status as an AIDS patient from the other members of the firm. A partner in the firm notices a lesion on Beckett's forehead. Although Beckett attributes the lesion to a racquetball injury, it indicates Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-defining condition."", ""Shortly thereafter, Beckett stays home from work for several days to try to find a way to hide his lesions. While at home, he finishes the paperwork for a case he has been assigned and then brings it to his office, leaving instructions for his assistants to file the paperwork the following day, which marks the end of the statute of limitations for the case. Later that morning, he receives a call asking for the paperwork, as the paper copy cannot be found and there are no copies on the computer's hard drive. The paperwork is finally discovered in an alternate location and is filed with the court at the last possible moment. The following day, Beckett is dismissed by the firm's partners."", ""Beckett believes that someone deliberately hid his paperwork to give the firm an excuse to fire him, and that the dismissal is actually a result of his diagnosis with AIDS as well as his sexuality. He asks ten attorneys to take his case, including African-American personal injury lawyer Joe Miller, whom Beckett previously opposed in an unrelated case. Miller appears to be worried that he could contract Beckett's illness. After declining to take the case, Miller immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have contracted the disease. The doctor explains that the routes of HIV infection do not include casual contact."", 'Unable to find a lawyer willing to represent him, Beckett is compelled to act as his own attorney. While researching a case at a law library, Miller sees Beckett at a nearby table. A librarian approaches Beckett and announces that he has found a case on AIDS discrimination for him.

Seeing the parallels in how he himself has faced discrimination due to his race, Miller approaches Beckett, reviews the material he has gathered, and takes the case.', ""As the case goes before the court, the partners of the firm take the stand, each claiming that Beckett was incompetent and that he had deliberately tried to hide his condition. The defense repeatedly suggests that Beckett brought AIDS upon himself via gay sex, and is therefore not a victim. In the course of testimony, it is revealed that the partner who had noticed Beckett's lesion, Walter Kenton, had previously worked with a woman who had contracted AIDS after a blood transfusion and so should have recognized the lesion as relating to AIDS.  According to Kenton, the woman was an innocent victim, unlike Beckett, and further testified that he did not recognize Beckett's lesions. To prove that the lesions would have been visible, Miller asks Beckett to unbutton his shirt while on the witness stand, revealing that his lesions are indeed visible and recognizable as such. Over the course of the trial, Miller's homophobia slowly disappears as he and Beckett bond from working together."", 'Beckett eventually collapses during the trial and is hospitalized. After this, another partner, Bob Seidman, who had also noticed Beckett\'s lesions, confesses that he suspected Beckett had AIDS but never told anyone and never gave him the opportunity to explain himself, which he regrets very much. During his hospitalization, the jury votes in Beckett\'s favor, awarding him back pay, damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages, totaling over $5\xa0million. Miller visits the visibly failing Beckett in the hospital after the verdict and overcomes his fear enough to touch Beckett\'s face. After the family leaves the room, Beckett tells his partner Miguel Alvarez that he is ""ready."" At the Miller home later that night, Miller and his wife are awakened by a phone call from Alvarez, who tells them that Beckett has died. A memorial is held at Beckett\'s family home following the funeral, where many mourners, including Miller and his family, view home movies of Beckett as a happy child.']]","[<a class=""external text"" href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107818/"" rel=""nofollow""><i>Philadelphia</i></a>]"

Bertie is frustrated at the experiment but Lionel gives him the acetate recording that he has made of the reading as a souvenir.After Bertie\'s father, King George V, broadcasts his 1934 Royal Christmas Message, he explains to Bertie that the wireless will play a significant part in the role of the royal family, allowing them to enter the homes of the people, and that Bertie\'s brother\'s neglect of his responsibilities make training in it necessary.

Gittes photographs Mulwray with a young woman, and the images are published in the next day\'s newspaper. Back at his office, Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him.', ""Realizing he was set up, Gittes assumes that Hollis Mulwray is the real target.

Now working for Evelyn, Gittes investigates Mulwray's death as a homicide. He discovers that although there is supposedly a drought, huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir every night. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman who slashes Gittes's left nostril.

Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the retirement home and confirm that other real-estate deals were surreptitiously transacted in the names of unknowing residents. Their visit is interrupted by the suspicious director, who has called Mulvihill.', ""After escaping Mulvihill and his thugs, Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn's house and sleep together.

He discovers that the garden pond is salt water and spots a pair of eyeglasses in it. He confronts Evelyn about Hollis's mistress, who Evelyn now claims is her daughter. Gittes slaps Evelyn repeatedly until she breaks down and reveals Katherine is both her sister and her daughter; her father raped her when she was 15 years old.

The writer has been told that Pi's life story would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells the writer the following story about his life:"", 'Pi\'s father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after Piscine Molitor, a famous swimming pool in France. In secondary school in Pondicherry, he adopts the Greek letter ""Pi"" as his nickname to avoid bullying. He is raised in a Hindu family, but at 12 years old, he is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and decides to follow all three religions as he ""just wants to love God"". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pi\'s family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in the animals, especially a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.', 'When Pi is 16, his father announces that they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship founders while Pi is on deck. He struggles to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a lifeboat. A freed zebra jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the Mariana Trench, drowning his family. Pi briefly sees what appears to be a survivor, but it turns out to be the tiger, Richard Parker.', 'After the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra and is joined by a resourceful orangutan. A spotted hyena emerges from under a tarpaulin covering half of the lifeboat and snaps at Pi, forcing him to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker emerges from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover for several days.', 'Pi fashions a small raft from flotation vests which he teathers to the lifeboat to which he retreats for safety from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger as well. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then comes threateningly towards Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him back into the boat. One night, a humpback whale comes too close to the boat, destroying the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat, and realizes that caring for the tiger is also helping keep himself alive.', 'Weeks later they encounter a floating island of interconnected trees. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, freshwater pools and a large population of meerkats, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat and drink freely and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn acidic, digesting the fish in them. Pi deduces that the island is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.', ""Pi and Richard Parker leave the island, eventually reaching the coast of Mexico. Pi is saddened that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. He is rescued and brought to a hospital. Insurance agents for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by human survivors: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable sailor for the zebra, and the ship's brutish cook for the hyena. In this story, the cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He also kills Pi's mother after which Pi kills him with a knife and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story, but they leave without questioning Pi further."", 'The writer recognizes the parallels between the two stories, noting that in the second version Pi is actually Richard Parker. Pi says that it does not matter which story is the truth because his family still died either way. He then asks which story the author prefers, and the author chooses the first, to which Pi replies, ""and so it goes with God"". Glancing at a copy of the official insurance report, the writer reads aloud that Pi survived his great adventure ""in the company of an adult Bengal tiger.""']]","[<a class=""external text"" href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454876/"" rel=""nofollow""><i>Life of Pi</i></a>]"

After Latika leaves, Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, waiting for Javed to realise Latika is free.', 'For the final question, Jamal is asked the name of the third musketeer.

Other recruits include John Rawlins, Jupiter Sharts, Trip, and a mute teenage drummer boy.', ""The men learn that in response to the Emancipation Proclamation, the Confederacy has issued an order that all black soldiers will be returned to slavery. Black soldiers found in a Union uniform will be executed as well as their white officers. They are offered but turn down a chance to take an honorable discharge. They undergo rigorous training from Sergeant-Major Mulcahy, who is particularly hard on Searles. Despite Mulcahy's treatment of his friend, Shaw reluctantly realizes the tough discipline is needed to prepare them for the coming challenges the regiment must face."", ""Trip goes AWOL and is caught; Shaw orders him flogged in front of the regiment. He then learns that Trip left to find regular-issue shoes because his men are being denied these supplies. Shaw confronts the base's racist quartermaster on their behalf. Shaw also supports his men in a pay dispute; the federal government decrees that black soldiers will only be paid $10, not the $13 per month all white soldiers receive. When the men, led by Trip, begin tearing up their pay vouchers in protest of this unequal treatment, Shaw tears up his own voucher in support of his men. In recognition of the leadership he has displayed, Rawlins is promoted by Shaw to the rank of sergeant major."", 'Once the 54th completes its training, the 54th regiment is transferred to serve under the command of Brigadier General Charles Harker. On the way to South Carolina, the 54th is ordered by Colonel James Montgomery to sack and burn Darien, Georgia. Shaw initially refuses to obey an unlawful order but reluctantly agrees under threat of facing a court-martial and being relieved of his command. He continues to lobby his superiors to allow his regiment to join the fight, as its duties to date have involved mostly manual labor. Shaw finally gets the 54th a combat assignment after he blackmails Harker by threatening to report the illegal activities he has discovered. In its first battle at James Island, South Carolina, the 54th successfully repels a Confederate attack that had routed other units. During the battle, Searles is wounded but saves Trip. Shaw offers Trip the honor of bearing the regimental flag in battle. He declines, unsure if winning the war would result in a better life for ex-slaves like himself.', 'General George Strong informs Shaw along with other commanders of a major campaign to secure a foothold at Charleston Harbor. This involves assaulting Morris Island and capturing Fort Wagner, whose only landward approach is a strip of open beach; a charge is certain to result in heavy casualties. Shaw volunteers the 54th to lead the attack. The night before the battle, the black soldiers conduct a religious service. Several make emotional speeches to inspire others, including Trip, who finally embraces his fellow soldiers. On its way to the battlefield, the 54th is cheered by the same Union troops who had scorned them earlier.', ""The 54th leads the dusk charge on the fort, suffering serious losses. As night falls, the regiment is pinned down against the fort's walls. Attempting to encourage his men forward, Shaw is killed by numerous gunshots. Trip, despite his previous assertion that he would not do it, lifts the flag to rally the soldiers to continue, but he too is soon shot dead. Forbes and Rawlins take charge, and the soldiers break through the fort's outer defenses. Seemingly on the brink of victory, Forbes, Rawlins, Searles, Sharts, and the two color sergeants are fired upon by Confederate artillery. The morning after the battle, the beach is littered with the bodies of black and white Union soldiers; the Confederate flag is raised over the fort. The dead Union soldiers are buried in a mass communal grave, with Shaw and Trip's bodies next to each other."", 'A textual epilogue reveals that while Fort Wagner never fell to the Union Army, the courage demonstrated by the 54th resulted in the United States accepting thousands of black men for combat, and President Abraham Lincoln credited them with helping to turn the tide of the war.']]",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/glory?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1c

When Grace asks Mrs. Mills about her previous experience in the house, Mrs. Mills recounts that many left due to an outbreak of tuberculosis.', 'At night, Grace witnesses a piano playing itself and becomes convinced that the house is haunted.

Davis. Several months after Walter\'s disappearance, the LAPD tells Christine that the boy has been found alive. Believing the positive publicity will negate recent criticism of the department, the LAPD organizes a public reunion. Although ""Walter"" claims he is Christine\'s son, she says he is not. Captain J.J. Jones, the head of the LAPD\'s Juvenile Division, insists the boy is Walter and pressures Christine into taking him home ""on a trial basis"".', 'After Christine confronts Jones with physical discrepancies between ""Walter"" and her son, Jones arranges for a medical doctor to visit her.

Both Walter\'s teacher and his dentist give Christine signed letters asserting that ""Walter"" is an impostor.

Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder around twenty children, and he identifies Walter as one of them. Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark\'s deportation, but Ybarra takes Clark to the murder site and tells him to dig where the bodies are buried. Clark hesitates, but he soon uncovers body parts.

Under interrogation by Ybarra, Walter\'s impostor reveals that his motive was to secure transport to Los Angeles to see his favorite actor, Tom Mix, and says the police told him to lie about being Christine\'s son. The police capture Northcott in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Meanwhile, Briegleb introduces Christine and her case to famed attorney ""S.S.""

At the Covent Garden fruit-and-vegetable market one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach even Eliza Doolittle, the young flower seller woman with a strong Cockney accent, to speak so well he could pass her off as a duchess at an embassy ball. Eliza\'s ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (""Wouldn\'t It Be Loverly""). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins\' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees and describes how women ruin lives (""I\'m an Ordinary Man"").', 'Eliza\'s father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter\'s new residence (""With a Little Bit of Luck""). He shows up at Higgins\' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter\'s virtue, but in reality to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man\'s honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality.', 'Eliza endures Higgins\' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally (""Just You Wait""), while the servants feel both annoyed with the noise as well as pitiful for Higgins (""Servants\' Chorus"").

At Ascot, she meets Freddy Eynsford-Hill, a young, upper-class man who becomes infatuated with her (""On the Street Where You Live"").', 'Higgins then takes Eliza to an embassy ball for the final test, where she dances with a foreign prince. Also present is Zoltan Karpathy, a Hungarian phonetics expert trained by Higgins, who is an impostor detector. After he dances with Eliza, he declares that she is a Hungarian princess.', 'Afterward, Eliza\'s hard work is barely acknowledged, with all the praise going to Higgins (""You Did It"").

Outside, Freddy is still waiting (""On the Street Where You Live (Reprise)"") and greets Eliza, who is irritated by him as all he does is talk (""Show Me"").

Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to learn ""the big con"". Unfortunately, the reason their victim had so much cash was that he was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan\'s involvement and demanding part of Hooker\'s cut. Having already blown his share on a single roulette spin, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan\'s men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago.', 'Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and recruits a core team of experienced con men to dupe Lonnegan. They decide to resurrect an elaborate obsolete scam known as ""the wire"", using a larger crew of con artists to create a phony off-track betting parlor. Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan\'s private, high-stakes poker game. He infuriates Lonnegan with obnoxious behavior, then outcheats him to win $15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw\'s disgruntled employee Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw\'s operation. Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago Western Union office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by past-posting.', 'Meanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their plan to arrest Gondorff using Hooker. At the same time, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with the inability of his men to find and kill Hooker for the Joliet con. Unaware that Kelly is Hooker, he demands that Salino, his best assassin, be given the job. A mysterious figure with black leather gloves is then seen following and observing Hooker.', ""Kelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the trifecta of another. Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before FBI Agent Polk. Polk forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow."", ""The night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with a waitress named Loretta. The next morning, he sees Loretta walking toward him. The black-gloved man appears behind Hooker and shoots her dead. The man reveals that he was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker; Loretta was Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino, and had not yet killed Hooker because they were seen together."", 'Armed with Harmon\'s tip to ""place it on Lucky Dan"", Lonnegan makes the $500,000 bet at Shaw\'s parlor on Lucky Dan to win. As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan\'s bet: when he said ""place it"" he meant, literally, that Lucky Dan would ""place"" (i.e., finish second). In a panic, Lonnegan rushes the teller window and demands his money back. A moment later Polk, Lt. Snyder, and a half dozen FBI agents storm the parlor. Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go. Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back. Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter. The gunshots were faked; Agent Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff\'s con to divert Snyder and ensure Lonnegan abandons the money. As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money, saying ""I\'d only blow it"", and walks away with Gondorff.']]",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-sting?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1c

He meets his friend, Police Detective Tom Polhaus, at the murder scene, and tries calling his client at her hotel to discover she has checked out. Back at his apartment, he is grilled by Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy, who tell him that Thursby was also murdered the same evening.

Tony arranges a meeting with Swann on a pretext, and tells him of Margot's affair. Six months previously, Tony had stolen Margot's handbag, which contained a love letter from Mark, and anonymously blackmailed her. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony blackmails him—Swann can either accept £1,000 to kill Margot, or be turned in as Margot's blackmailer. Swann agrees to the murder and Tony explains his plan: Tony will accompany Mark to a party, leaving Margot at home. He will hide Margot's latchkey under the foyer carpet and Swann will use it to sneak into the flat and hide. Tony will telephone from the party and Swann will kill Margot when she answers the call. Swann will leave signs of a burglary gone wrong and replace the key under the foyer carpet when he leaves."", ""The following night, while Margot is in bed, Swann enters the flat and waits. Tony calls and, when Margot comes to the phone, Swann tries to strangle her with his scarf, but she stabs him with scissors and kills him. When Margot grabs the phone and pleads for help, Tony tells her not to speak to anyone. Tony returns to the flat, calls the police, sends Margot to bed, and moves what he thinks is her latchkey from Swann's pocket into her handbag. Before the police arrive, Tony attempts to frame Margot by planting Mark's letter on Swann and destroying Swann's scarf."", ""The following day, Tony persuades Margot to hide the fact that he told her not to call the police. Chief Inspector Hubbard arrives and questions the Wendices and Margot makes several conflicting statements. When Hubbard says the evidence indicates that Swann entered through the front door, Tony claims that Swann must have been responsible for stealing Margot's handbag, and made a copy of her key. As Tony intends, Hubbard does not believe the story and arrests Margot after concluding that she killed Swann for blackmailing her. Margot is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death."", 'Months later, on the day before Margot\'s scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony, saying he has devised a story for him to tell the police to save Margot.

Deducing that the money was Tony\'s intended payoff to Swann, Mark confronts Tony and explains his theory to Hubbard.

Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tony\'s. As soon as Tony leaves, Hubbard uses Tony\'s key to re-enter the flat, followed by Mark. Hubbard had already discovered that the key in Margot\'s handbag was Swann\'s own latchkey and deduced that Swann had put the Wendices\' key back in its hiding-place after unlocking the door.

Carnehan tells Kipling the story of how he and his comrade-in-arms Danny Dravot, ex-sergeants of the British Army who had become adventurers, travelled far beyond India into the remote land of Kafiristan.', ""Three years earlier, Dravot and Carnehan had met Kipling under less than auspicious circumstances. After stealing Kipling's pocket-watch, Carnehan found a masonic tag on the chain, and realising he had robbed a fellow Freemason, felt he had to return it. At the time, he and Dravot were working on a plot to blackmail a local raja, which Kipling foiled by getting the British district commissioner to intervene. In a comic relief turn, Carnehan obliquely blackmails the commissioner in order to avoid deportation."", ""Frustrated at the lack of opportunities for lucrative criminal mischief, in an India becoming more civilised and regulated — partly through their own hard efforts as soldiers — and with little to look forward to in the United Kingdom except dreary, poorly paid jobs, the two turn up at Kipling's office with an audacious plan. Forsaking India, they will head with twenty rifles and ammunition to Kafiristan, a country virtually unknown to Europeans since its conquest by Alexander the Great. There they will offer their services to a ruler and then help him to conquer his neighbours, but proceed to overthrow him and loot the country. Kipling, after first trying to dissuade them, gives Dravot his masonic tag as a token of brotherhood."", ""After signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty and forswearing women and drink, the two set off on an epic overland journey north beyond the Khyber Pass. Over the next few weeks, they travel through Afghanistan, fighting off bandits, blizzards and avalanches, as they make their way into the unknown land of Kafiristan. They chance upon a Gurkha soldier, Billy Fish, the sole survivor of a years past, British expedition. Speaking English as well as the local language, Billy smooths their way as they begin their rise, first offering their services to the chief of a much-raided village.

With their enemies vanquished, nobody is left to stand in their way, as they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul by the high priest of the region. He sets up a re-enactment of the arrow incident, to determine whether Dravot is a man or a god by seeing whether or not he bleeds. When his shirt is torn open, they are amazed to see the masonic tag around his neck. It contains the sacred symbol left by Sikander, their name for Alexander the Great, who had promised to send a son to rule over them.', ""Hailing Dravot as king as well as god, they show him the royal treasury, which is full of unimaginable amounts of gold and jewels that are now all his. Carnehan suggests that they leave with as much loot as they can carry as soon as the snows have melted on the mountain passes. Dravot, however, is beginning to enjoy the adulation of the locals, settling their disputes and issuing laws, and even dreams of visiting Queen Victoria as an equal. He is also struck by the beauty of a girl called Roxane, the name of Alexander's wife, and cancels their pact to avoid women, saying he will marry her in order to leave the people an heir. When she is reluctantly brought to him, he tries to kiss her, but she, terrified that the touch of a god means death to a mortal, bites his cheek. Seeing him bleed, the people realise he is only human and try to grab the British impostors."", 'Outnumbered in the ensuing battle, Dravot is captured and is made to walk onto a rope bridge, where he lustily sings the hymn ""The Son of God Goes Forth to War"". When the ropes are cut, he falls thousands of feet to his death. Carnehan is crucified between two pine trees, but upon being found still alive the next morning, is freed. Crippled in body and unhinged in mind from his ordeal, he eventually makes his way back to India as a beggar. Finishing his story, he leaves Kipling\'s office after putting a bundle on the desk.

It is also influenced by Life Is with People, by Mark Zborowski and Elizabeth Herzog.[2] Aleichem wrote a dramatic adaptation of the stories that he left unfinished at his death, but which was produced in Yiddish in 1919 by the Yiddish Art Theater and made into a film in the 1930s. In the late 1950s, a musical based on the stories, called Tevye and his Daughters, was produced Off-Broadway by Arnold Perl.[3] Rodgers and Hammerstein and then Mike Todd briefly considered bringing this musical to Broadway but dropped the idea.[4]', 'Investors and some in the media worried that Fiddler on the Roof might be considered ""too Jewish"" to attract mainstream audiences. Other critics considered that it was too culturally sanitized, ""middlebrow"" and superficial; Philip Roth, writing in The New Yorker, called it shtetl kitsch. For example, it portrays the local Russian officer as sympathetic, instead of brutal and cruel, as Sholom Aleichem had described him. Aleichem\'s stories ended with Tevye alone, his wife dead and his daughters scattered; at the end of Fiddler, the family members are alive, and most are emigrating together to America.[3][4] The show found the right balance for its time, even if not entirely authentic, to become ""one of the first popular post-Holocaust depictions of the vanished world of Eastern European Jewry"".[3] Harold Prince replaced the original producer Fred Coe and brought in director/choreographer Jerome Robbins.[5] The writers and Robbins considered naming the musical Tevye, before landing on a title suggested by various paintings by Marc Chagall (Green Violinist (1924),  Le Mort (1924), The Fiddler (1912)) that also inspired the original set design. Contrary to popular belief, the ""title of the musical does not refer to any specific painting"".[6]', 'During rehearsals, one of the stars, Jewish actor Zero Mostel, feuded with Robbins, whom he held in contempt, because Robbins had testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee and hid his Jewish heritage from the public.

Cooper became fascinated by gorillas at the age of 6.[17] In 1899, he was given a book from his uncle called Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa.[18] The book (written in 1861), chronicled the adventures of Paul Du Chaillu in Africa and his various encounters with the natives and wildlife there.[19] Cooper became fascinated with the stories involving the gorillas, in particular, Du Chaillu\'s depiction of a particular gorilla known for its ""extraordinary size"",[20] that the natives described as ""invincible"" and the ""King of the African Forest"".[21] When Du Chaillu and some natives encountered a gorilla later in the book he described it as a ""hellish dream creature"" that was ""half man, half beast"".[22]', 'As an adult, Cooper became involved in the motion picture industry. While filming The Four Feathers in Africa, he came into contact with a family of baboons.[23] This gave him the idea to make a picture about primates.[24] A year later when he got to RKO, Cooper wanted to film a ""terror gorilla picture"". As the story was being fleshed out, Cooper decided to make his gorilla giant sized. Cooper stated that the idea of Kong fighting warplanes on top of a building came from him seeing a plane flying over the New York Insurance Building, then the tallest building in the world.[25] He came up with the ending before the rest of the story as he stated, ""Without any conscious effort of thought I immediately saw in my mind\'s eye a giant gorilla on top of the building"".[26] Cooper also was influenced by Douglas Burden\'s accounts of the Komodo dragon,[27] and wanted to pit his terror gorilla against dinosaur-sized versions of these reptiles, stating to Burden, ""I also had firmly in mind to giantize both the gorilla and your dragons to make them really huge. However I always believed in personalizing and focusing attention on one main character and from the very beginning I intended to make it the gigantic gorilla, no matter what else I surrounded him with"".[27] Around this time, Cooper began to refer to his project as a ""giant terror gorilla picture"" featuring ""a gigantic semi-humanoid gorilla pitted against modern civilization"".[28]', 'When designing King Kong, Cooper wanted him to be a nightmarish gorilla monster. As he described Kong in a 1930 memo, ""His hands and feet have the size and strength of steam shovels; his girth is that of a steam boiler. This is a monster with the strength of a hundred men. But more terrifying is the head—a nightmare head with bloodshot eyes and jagged teeth set under a thick mat of hair, a face half-beast half-human"".[29] Willis O\'Brien created an oil painting depicting the giant gorilla menacing a jungle heroine and hunter for Cooper.[30][31] However, when it came time for O\'Brien and Marcel Delgado to sculpt the animation model, Cooper decided to backpedal on the half-human look for the creature and became adamant that Kong be a gorilla. O\'Brien on the other hand, wanted him to be almost human-like to gain audience empathy, and told Delgado to ""make that ape almost human"".[32] Cooper laughed at the end result, saying that it looked like a cross between a monkey and a man with very long hair.[32] For the second model, O\'Brien again asked Delgado to add human features but to tone it down somewhat. The end result (which was rejected) was described as looking like a missing link.[32] Disappointed, Cooper stated, ""I want Kong to be the fiercest, most brutal, monstrous damned thing that has ever been seen!""[32] On December 22, 1931, Cooper got the dimensions of a bull gorilla from the American Museum of Natural History telling O\'Brien, ""Now that\'s what I want!""[32] When the final model was created, it had the basic look of a gorilla but managed to retain some human-like qualities. For example, Delgado streamlined the body by removing the distinctive paunch and rump of a gorilla.[33] O\'Brien would incorporate some characteristics and nuances of an earlier creature he had created in 1915 for the silent short The Dinosaur and the Missing Link into the general look and personality of Kong, even going as far as to refer to the creature as ""Kong\'s ancestor"".[34][35] When it came time to film, Cooper agreed that Kong should walk upright at times (mostly in the New York sequences) in order to appear more intimidating.[36]', 'Merian C. Cooper was very fond of strong, hard-sounding words that started with the letter ""K"". Some of his favorite words were ""Komodo"", ""Kodiak"" and ""Kodak"".[37] When Cooper was envisioning his giant terror gorilla idea, he wanted to capture a real gorilla from the Congo and have it fight a real Komodo dragon on Komodo Island (this scenario would eventually evolve into Kong\'s battle with the tyrannosaur on Skull Island when the film was produced a few years later at RKO). Cooper\'s friend Douglas Burden\'s trip to the island of Komodo and his encounter with the Komodo dragons was a big influence on the Kong story.[38] Cooper was fascinated by Burden\'s adventures as chronicled in his book Dragon Lizards of Komodo where he referred to the animal as the ""King of Komodo"".[37] It was this phrase along with ""Komodo"" and ""Kongo""  [sic] (and his overall love for hard sounding ""K""-words)[39] that gave him the idea to name the giant ape ""Kong"". He loved the name, as it had a ""mystery sound"" to it.', 'After Cooper got to RKO, British mystery writer Edgar Wallace was contracted to write the first draft of the screen story. It was simply referred to as ""The Beast"". RKO executives were unimpressed with the bland title. David O. Selznick suggested Jungle Beast as the film\'s new title,[40] but Cooper was unimpressed and wanted to name the film after the main character. He stated he liked the ""mystery word"" aspect of Kong\'s name and that the film should carry ""the name of the leading mysterious, romantic, savage creature of the story"" such as with Dracula and Frankenstein.[40] RKO sent a memo to Cooper suggesting the titles Kong: King of Beasts, Kong: The Jungle King, and Kong: The Jungle Beast, which combined his and Selznick\'s proposed titles.[40] As time went on, Cooper would eventually name the story simply Kong while Ruth Rose was writing the final version of the screenplay. Because David O. Selznick thought that audiences would think that the film, with the one word title of Kong, would be mistaken as a docudrama like Grass and Chang, which were one-word titled films that Cooper had earlier produced, he added the ""King"" to Kong\'s name in order to differentiate it.[41]', 'In his first appearance in King Kong (1933), Kong was a gigantic prehistoric ape.[42] While gorilla-like in appearance, he had a vaguely humanoid look and at times walked upright in an anthropomorphic manner.[36]', 'Like most simians, Kong possesses semi-human intelligence and great physical strength. Kong\'s size changes drastically throughout the course of the film. While creator Merian C. Cooper envisioned Kong as being ""40 to 50 feet tall"",[43] animator Willis O\'Brien and his crew built the models and sets scaling Kong to be only 18 feet (5.5\xa0m) tall on Skull Island, and rescaled to be 24 feet (7.3\xa0m) tall in New York.[44]', ""This did not stop Cooper from playing around with Kong's size as he directed the special effect sequences; by manipulating the sizes of the miniatures and the camera angles, he made Kong appear a lot larger than O'Brien wanted, even as large as 60 feet (18.3\xa0m) in some scenes."", 'As Cooper stated in an interview:', ' ', ""Concurrently, the Kong bust made for the film was built in scale with a 40-foot (12.2\xa0m) ape,[46] while the full sized hand of Kong was built in scale with a 70-foot (21.3\xa0m) ape.[47] Meanwhile, RKO's promotional materials listed Kong's official height as 50 feet (15.2\xa0m).[42]"", 'In the 1960s, Toho Studios from Japan licensed the character for the films King Kong vs. Godzilla and King Kong Escapes. For more details on these versions of the character, see below.', 'In 1975, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis paid RKO for the remake rights to King Kong. This resulted in King Kong (1976). This Kong was an upright walking anthropomorphic ape, appearing even more human-like than the original. Also like the original, this Kong had semi-human intelligence and vast strength. In the 1976 film, Kong was scaled to be 42 feet (12.8\xa0m) tall on Skull island and rescaled to be 55 feet (16.8\xa0m) tall in New York.[48] Ten years later, Dino De Laurentiis got the approval from Universal to do a sequel called King Kong Lives. This Kong had more or less the same appearance and abilities, but tended to walk on his knuckles more often and was enlarged, scaled to 60 feet (18.3\xa0m).[49]', ""Universal Studios had planned to do a King Kong remake as far back as 1976. They finally followed through almost 30 years later, with a three-hour film directed by Peter Jackson. Jackson opted to make Kong a gigantic silverback gorilla without any anthropomorphic features. This Kong looked and behaved more like a real gorilla: he had a large herbivore's belly, walked on his knuckles without any upright posture, and even beat his chest with his palms as opposed to clenched fists. In order to ground his Kong in realism, Jackson and the Weta Digital crew gave a name to his fictitious species Megaprimatus kong and suggested it to have evolved from the Gigantopithecus. Kong was the last of his kind. He was portrayed in the film as being quite old, with graying fur and battle-worn with scars, wounds, and a crooked jaw from his many fights against rival creatures. He is the dominant being on the island, the king of his world. But, like his film predecessors, he possesses considerable intelligence and great physical strength; he also appears far more nimble and agile. This Kong was scaled to a consistent height of 25 feet (7.6\xa0m) tall on both Skull Island and in New York.[50] Jackson describes his central character: "", ""In the 2017 film Kong: Skull Island, Kong is scaled to be 104 feet (31.7\xa0m) tall,[52] making it the second largest and largest American incarnation in the series until the 2021 film Godzilla vs. Kong, in which he became the largest incarnation in the series, standing at 337 feet (102.7\xa0m).[53] Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts stated in regard to Kong's immense stature: "", ' He also stated that the original 1933 look was the inspiration for the design, saying: ', ' Co-producer Mary Parent also stated that Kong is still young and not fully grown as she explains, ""Kong is an adolescent when we meet him in the film; he\'s still growing into his role as alpha"".[56]', ""While one of the most famous movie icons in history, King Kong's intellectual property status has been questioned since his creation, featuring in numerous allegations and court battles. The rights to the character have always been split up with no single exclusive rights holder. Different parties have also contested that various aspects are public domain material and therefore ineligible for copyright status."", 'When Merian C. Cooper created King Kong, he assumed that he owned the character, which he had conceived in 1929, outright. Cooper maintained that he had only licensed the character to RKO for the initial film and sequel, but had otherwise owned his own creation. In 1935, Cooper began to feel something was amiss when he was trying to get a Tarzan vs. King Kong project off the ground for Pioneer Pictures (where he had assumed management of the company). After David O. Selznick suggested the project to Cooper, the flurry of legal activity over using the Kong character that followed—Pioneer had become a completely independent company by this time and access to properties that RKO felt were theirs was no longer automatic—gave Cooper pause as he came to realize that he might not have full control over this product of his own imagination after all.[57]', ""Years later in 1962, Cooper found out that RKO was licensing the character through John Beck to Toho studios in Japan for a film project called King Kong vs. Godzilla. Cooper had assumed his rights were unassailable and was bitterly opposed to the project. In 1963 he filed a lawsuit to enjoin distribution of the movie against John Beck, as well as Toho and Universal (the film's U.S. copyright holder).[58] Cooper discovered that RKO had also profited from licensed products featuring the King Kong character such as model kits produced by Aurora Plastics Corporation. Cooper's executive assistant, Charles B. FitzSimons, stated that these companies should be negotiating through him and Cooper for such licensed products and not RKO. In a letter to Robert Bendick, Cooper stated:"", 'Cooper and his legal team offered up various documents to bolster the case that Cooper owned King Kong and had only licensed the character to RKO for two films, rather than selling him outright. Many people vouched for Cooper\'s claims, including David O. Selznick, who had written a letter to Mr. A. Loewenthal of the Famous Artists Syndicate in Chicago in 1932 stating (in regard to Kong), ""The rights of this are owned by Mr. Merian C. Cooper.""[59] But Cooper had lost key documents through the years (he discovered these papers were missing after he returned from his World War II military service) such as a key informal yet binding letter from Mr. Ayelsworth (the then-president of the RKO Studio Corp.) and a formal binding letter from Mr. B. B. Kahane (the current president of RKO Studio Corp.) confirming that Cooper had only licensed the rights to the character for the two RKO pictures and nothing more.[60]', ""Without these letters, it seemed Cooper's rights were relegated to the Lovelace novelization that he had copyrighted (he was able to make a deal for a Bantam Books paperback reprint and a Gold Key comic adaptation of the novel, but that was all that he could do). Cooper's lawyer had received a letter from John Beck's lawyer, Gordon E. Youngman, that stated:"", 'In a letter addressed to Douglas Burden, Cooper lamented:', ""The rights over the character did not flare up again until 1975, when Universal Studios and Dino De Laurentiis were fighting over who would be able to do a King Kong remake for release the following year. De Laurentiis came up with $200,000 to buy the remake rights from RKO.[62] When Universal got wind of this, they filed a lawsuit against RKO, claiming that they had a verbal agreement from them regarding the remake. During the legal battles that followed, which eventually included RKO countersuing Universal, as well as De Laurentiis filing a lawsuit claiming interference, Colonel Richard Cooper (Merian's son and now head of the Cooper estate) jumped into the fray.[63]"", ""During the battles, Universal discovered that the copyright of the Lovelace novelization had expired without renewal, thus making the King Kong story a public domain one. Universal argued that they should be able to make a movie based on the novel without infringing on anyone's copyright because the characters in the story were in the public domain within the context of the public domain story.[64] Richard Cooper then filed a cross-claim against RKO claiming that, while the publishing rights to the novel had not been renewed, his estate still had control over the plot/story of King Kong.[63]"", 'In a four-day bench trial in Los Angeles, Judge Manuel Real made the final decision and gave his verdict on November 24, 1976, affirming that the King Kong novelization and serialization were indeed in the public domain, and Universal could make its movie as long as it did not infringe on original elements in the 1933 RKO film,[65] which had not passed into the public domain[66] (Universal postponed their plans to film a King Kong movie, called The Legend of King Kong, for at least 18 months, after cutting a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that included a percentage of box office profits from his remake).[67]', 'However, on December 6, 1976, Judge Real made a subsequent ruling, which held that all the rights in the name, character, and story of King Kong (outside of the original film and its sequel) belonged to Merian C. Cooper\'s estate. This ruling, which became known as the ""Cooper judgment"", expressly stated that it would not change the previous ruling that publishing rights of the novel and serialization were in the public domain. It was a huge victory that affirmed the position Merian C. Cooper had maintained for years.[65] Shortly thereafter, Richard Cooper sold all his rights (excluding worldwide book and periodical publishing rights) to Universal in December 1976. In 1980 Judge Real dismissed the claims that were brought forth by RKO and Universal four years earlier and reinstated the Cooper judgement.[68]', 'In 1982 Universal filed a lawsuit against Nintendo, which had created an impish ape character called Donkey Kong in 1981 and was reaping huge profits over the video game machines. Universal claimed that Nintendo was infringing on its copyright because Donkey Kong was a blatant rip-off of King Kong.[68] During the court battle and subsequent appeal, the courts ruled that Universal did not have exclusive trademark rights to the King Kong character. The courts ruled that trademark was not among the rights Cooper had sold to Universal, indicating that ""Cooper plainly did not obtain any trademark rights in his judgment against RKO, since the California district court specifically found that King Kong had no secondary meaning.""[66] While they had a majority of the rights, they did not outright own the King Kong name and character.[69] The courts ruling noted that the name, title, and character of Kong no longer signified a single source of origin so exclusive trademark rights were impossible.[70] The courts also pointed out that the Kong rights were held by three parties:', 'The judge then ruled that ""Universal thus owns only those rights in the King Kong name and character that RKO, Cooper, or DDL do not own.""[71]', 'The court of appeals would also note:', 'Because Universal misrepresented their degree of ownership of King Kong (claiming they had exclusive trademark rights when they knew that they did not) and tried to have it both ways in court regarding the ""public domain"" claims, the courts ruled that Universal acted in bad faith (see Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.). They were ordered to pay fines and all of Nintendo\'s legal costs from the lawsuit. That, along with the fact that the courts ruled that there was simply no likelihood of people confusing Donkey Kong with King Kong,[69] caused Universal to lose the case and the subsequent appeal.', ""Since the court case, Universal still retains the majority of the character rights. In 1986 they opened a King Kong ride called King Kong Encounter at their Universal Studios Tour theme park in Hollywood (which was destroyed in 2008 by a backlot fire), and followed it up with the Kongfrontation ride at their Orlando park in 1990 (which was closed down in 2002 due to maintenance issues). They also finally made a King Kong film of their own, King Kong (2005). In the summer of 2010, Universal opened a new 3D King Kong ride called King Kong: 360 3-D at their Hollywood park, replacing the destroyed King Kong Encounter.[73] On July 13, 2016, Universal opened a new King Kong attraction called Skull Island: Reign of Kong at Islands of Adventure in Orlando.[74] In July 2013, Legendary Pictures reached an agreement with Universal in which it will market, co-finance, and distribute Legendary's films for five years starting in 2014, the year that Legendary's similar agreement with Warner Bros. Pictures was set to expire. Later, in July 2014 at the San Diego Comic-Con, Legendary announced (as a product of its partnership with Universal), a King Kong origin story, initially titled Skull Island, with Universal distributing.[75] On December 12, 2014, the studio announced they had re-titled the film Kong: Skull Island. On September 10, 2015, it was announced that Universal would allow Legendary to move Kong: Skull Island to Warner Bros.,[76] so they could do a King Kong and Godzilla crossover film (in the continuity of the 2014 Godzilla movie), since Legendary still had the rights to make more Godzilla movies with Warner Bros. before their contract with Toho expired in 2020.[77][78]"", ""As noted above, Richard Cooper, through the Merian C. Cooper Estate, retained publishing rights for the content that Judge Real had ruled on December 6, 1976, belonged to Richard Cooper. In 1990, they licensed a six-issue comic book adaptation of the novelization of the 1933 film to Monster Comics, and commissioned an illustrated novel in 1994 called Anthony Browne's King Kong. In 2013, they became involved with a musical stage play based on the story, called King Kong: The Eighth Wonder of the World which premiered in June 2013 in Australia[79][80] and then on Broadway in November 2018.[81] The production is involved with Global Creatures, the company behind the Walking with Dinosaurs arena show.[82] In 1996, artist/writer Joe DeVito partnered the Merian C. Cooper estate to write and/or illustrate various publications based on Merian C. Cooper's King Kong property through his company, DeVito ArtWorks, LLC. Through this partnership, DeVito created the prequel/sequel story Skull Island on which DeVito based a pair of original novels relating the origin of King Kong: Kong: King of Skull Island, and King Kong of Skull Island. In addition, the Cooper/DeVito collaboration resulted in an origin-themed comic book miniseries with Boom! Studios,[83] an expanded rewrite of the original Lovelace novelization, Merian C. Cooper's King Kong, (the original novelization's publishing rights are still in the public domain), and various crossovers with other franchises such as Doc Savage, Tarzan[84] and Planet of the Apes.[85] In 2016, DeVito ArtWorks, through its licensing program, licensed its King Kong property to RocketFizz for use in the marketing of a soft drink called King Kong Cola.[86] and have plans for a live action TV show to be co-produced between MarVista Entertainment and IM Global.[87] In April 2016, Joe DeVito sued Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros., producers of the film Kong: Skull Island, for using elements of his Skull Island universe, which he claimed that he created and that the producers had used without his permission.[88]"", 'RKO (whose rights consisted of only the original film and its sequel) signed over the North American, Latin American and Australian distribution rights to its film library to Ted Turner in a period spanning 1986 to 1989 via his company Turner Entertainment.

Among kaiju, King Kong was suggested to be among the most powerful in terms of raw physical force, possessing strength and durability that rivaled that of Godzilla. As one of the few mammal-based kaiju, Kong's most distinctive feature was his intelligence. He demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt to an opponent's fighting style, identify and exploit weaknesses in an enemy, and utilize his environment to stage ambushes and traps.[91]"", ""In King Kong vs. Godzilla, Kong was scaled to be 45\xa0m (148\xa0ft) tall.

Elements of King Kong's character remained in the film, reflected in Godzilla's uncharacteristic behavior and attraction to the female character Daiyo.[95] Toho and Rankin/Bass later negotiated their differences and co-produced King Kong Escapes in 1967, loosely based on Rankin/Bass' animated show."", ""Toho Studios wanted to remake King Kong vs. Godzilla, which was the most successful of the entire Godzilla series of films, in 1991 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film, as well as to celebrate Godzilla's upcoming 40th anniversary.

Fink is assigned to a wrestling film by his new boss Jack Lipnick (Lerner), but he finds difficulty in writing for the unfamiliar subject. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to complain. His neighbor Charlie Meadows (Goodman), the source of the noise, visits Fink to apologize. During their conversation, Fink proclaims his affection for ""the common man"", and Meadows describes his life as an insurance salesman.', ""Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Fink consults producer Ben Geisler (Shalhoub) for advice. Irritated, the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance. Fink accidentally meets the novelist W. P. Mayhew (Mahoney) in the bathroom. They briefly discuss movie-writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day. Fink later learns from Mayhew's secretary, Audrey Taylor (Davis), that Mayhew suffers from alcoholism and that Taylor ghostwrote most of his scripts. With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the movie, Fink phones Taylor and begs her for assistance. Taylor visits him at the Earle and they have sex.

Stunned, Fink places the box on his desk without opening it and he begins writing feverishly. Fink produces the entire script in one sitting and he goes out for a night of celebratory dancing.

In a final meeting with Lipnick, Fink\'s script is lambasted as ""a fruity movie about suffering"", and he is informed that he is to remain in Los Angeles; although Fink will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes until he ""grows up a little"". Dazed, Fink wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks just like the one in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box.

Entering the territory as a young lawyer, Ranse is beaten and robbed by Liberty Valance and his gang. Tom Doniphon finds Ranse and takes him to Shinbone, where Tom's girlfriend, Hallie, treats his wounds. Ranse learns Valance terrorizes the area and not even the town's Marshal Appleyard can stop him. Only Tom stands up to Valance, who only understands force. Ranse is determined to bring Valance to justice through the law rather than by force. "", ""While establishing his law practice, Ranse buses tables at Peter Ericson's restaurant, where Hallie works; and, opens a school for both children and adults in the back of the Shinbone Star newspaper office after befriending its editor, Dutton Peabody. He also begins practicing with a gun after Valance bullies him in the restaurant, during which Tom intervenes with threat of force against Valance. Hallie, attracted to Ranse and concerned for his safety, tells Tom of Ranse's gun practice. Tom warns Ranse of Valance's trickery. Tom also makes sure Ranse understands Hallie is Tom's girl by showing renovations to his ranch house are intended for his marriage to her. "", ""Shinbone's men meet to elect two delegates to the forthcoming statehood convention at the territorial capital. Ranse and Peabody are elected. Valance, hired by the cattle barons, who oppose statehood,  crashes the meeting, but fails to bully the town in electing him as a delegate. Valance challenges Ranse to a gunfight to be held later in the evening. Tom offers to assist Ranse in leaving town, but Ranse stubbornly declines."", ""That evening, Valance and his gang vandalize the newspaper office and nearly beat Peabody to death after Peabody ran a story implicating Valance in the murder of some local farmers. Ranse discovers Peabody and sends word to Valance that he is waiting for him. Valance exits the saloon and toys with Ranse, shooting him in the arm, before preparing for the kill shot. Ranse fires his gun and Valance drops dead. Ranse  returns to Ericson's where Hallie treats his arm. Tom enters and sees Hallie's affection for Ranse as she attends his wounds. Tom gets drunk and returns to his ranch house where he sets it ablaze, including the renovations planned for his marriage to Hallie. Tom's handyman, Pompey, prevents him from dying in the fire."", ""At the territorial convention, Ranse decides to withdraw as a candidate for delegate to Congress, concluding he is not worthy due to his killing Valance.  Tom arrives and explains to Ranse, in an inception flashback, that it was he, Tom, not Ranse, that killed Valance by sniping from across the street. Tom encourages Ranse to accept the nomination for Hallie's sake and he does."", 'In the present, Stoddard\'s political accomplishments fill in the intervening years, but editor Scott says Stoddard\'s story about who killed Valance will not be published, stating, ""This is the West, sir.

Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist and interpreter for The New York Times, awaits the arrival of reporter Sydney Schanberg at the city's airport, but leaves suddenly. Schanberg takes a cab to his hotel where he meets up with photographer Al Rockoff. Pran meets Schanberg later and tells him that an incident has occurred in a town, Neak Leung; allegedly, an American B-52 has bombed the town. Schanberg and Pran go to Neak Leung where they find that the town has been bombed. Schanberg and Pran are arrested when they try to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives. They are eventually released and Schanberg is furious when the international press corps arrives with the U.S. Army. "", 'Two years later, in 1975, the Phnom Penh embassies are evacuated in anticipation of the arrival of the Khmer Rouge. Schanberg secures evacuation for Pran, his wife and their four children. However, Pran insists on staying behind to help Schanberg. The Khmer Rouge move into the capital, ostensibly in peace. During a parade through the city, Schanberg meets Rockoff. They are later met by a detachment of the Khmer Rouge, who immediately arrest them. The group is taken through the city to a back alley where prisoners are being held and executed. Pran, unharmed because he is a Cambodian civilian, negotiates to spare the lives of his friends. They do not leave Phnom Penh, but instead retreat to the French embassy. The Khmer Rouge orders all Cambodian citizens in the embassy to be handed over. Fearing an attack from the Khmer Rouge, the ambassador complies. Knowing that Pran will be imprisoned or killed, Rockoff and fellow photographer Jon Swain of The Sunday Times try to forge a British passport for Pran, but the deception fails when the image of Pran on the passport photo fades to nothing, as they lack adequate photographic fixer. Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge and is forced to live under their totalitarian regime.', 'Several months after returning to New York City, Schanberg is in the midst of a personal campaign to locate Pran; he writes letters to several charities and is in close contact with Pran\'s family in San Francisco. In Cambodia, Pran has become a forced labourer under the Khmer Rouge\'s ""Year Zero"" policy, a return to the agrarian ways of the past. Pran is also forced to attend propagandist classes where many undergo re-education. As intellectuals are made to disappear, Pran feigns simple-mindedness. Eventually, he tries to escape, but is recaptured. Before he is found by members of the Khmer Rouge, he stumbles upon one of the infamous Killing Fields of the Pol Pot regime, where as many as 2\xa0million Cambodian citizens were murdered (for specific figure, please read article Cambodian genocide). In 1976, Schanberg is awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Cambodian conflict. During the ceremony, he tells the audience that American policy toward Cambodia was not considerate toward Cambodians themselves, and that half the recognition for the award belongs to Pran. Schanberg is confronted in the restroom by Rockoff, who harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate Pran and for using his friend to win the award. Although Schanberg initially defends his efforts, he ultimately admits that Pran stayed because of what Schanberg wanted.', 'Pran is assigned to the leader of a different prison compound, a man named Phat, and charged mostly with tending to Phat\'s young son. Pran continues to behave as an uneducated peasant, despite several attempts by Phat to catch him in his deception. Phat begins to trust Pran and asks him to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed. During the Khmer Rouge\'s border war with Vietnam, Pran discovers that Phat\'s son has American money and a map leading to safety. When Phat tries to stop the younger Khmer Rouge officers from killing several of his comrades, he is ignominiously shot. In the confusion, Pran escapes with four other prisoners and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phat\'s son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction; Pran continues following the map with the fourth man. However, Pran\'s companion activates a hidden land mine while holding the boy. As Pran pleads with the man to give him the boy, the mine goes off, killing the pair. Pran continues through the jungle alone until he eventually finds a Red Cross refugee camp near the border of Thailand. In the United States, Schanberg receives news that Pran is alive and safe, and he travels to the Red Cross camp and is reunited with Pran. He asks Pran to forgive him; Pran answers, with a smile, ""Nothing to forgive, Sydney"", as the two embrace.']]","[<a class=""external text"" href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/"" rel=""nofollow""><i>The Killing Fields</i></a>]"

Will also wants to buy the Thornton family\'s old cottage and land, and is angered when the property\'s current owner, the wealthy Widow Tillane, accepts Sean\'s bid instead of his offer. Will then retaliates by refusing consent for Sean to marry his sister.', ""Some village residents—including Father Peter Lonergan and local matchmaker-cum-bookmaker Michaeleen Óge Flynn—trick Will Danaher into believing that Widow Tillane will marry him if Mary Kate is no longer under his roof. He gleefully allows the marriage, but he refuses to give Mary Kate her dowry when he finds he was deceived.[b] Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, professes no interest in obtaining the dowry; but to Mary Kate, the dowry represents her personal value to the community and her freedom. She insists that the dowry must be received to validate their marriage, causing an estrangement between her and Sean. The morning after their wedding, villagers arrive at the couple's cottage with Mary Kate's furniture, having persuaded Will to release it, but they could not convince him to pay the dower-money."", ""Sean's refusal to fight her brother is attributed to cowardice by Mary Kate. However, Sean reveals to the local Protestant Minister, Rev. Cyril Playfair, who also is a former boxer, that he once accidentally killed an opponent in the ring. Sean had sworn to give up fighting out of fear and guilt over the manslaughter, since the other man had a wife and children and was younger than him. Mary Kate also confesses her part in the quarrel to Father Lonergan, who berates her for her selfishness. She and Sean partially reconcile that night, and they share the bedroom for the first time since their marriage. "", 'However, the next morning, Mary Kate quietly leaves their cottage to board a train for Dublin, hoping this will spur Sean to action, though she does not actually want to leave. Sean soon learns from Michaeleen where she is, races his horse to the train station, and pulls her off the train. Followed by a growing crowd of villagers, Sean forces Mary Kate to walk with him the five miles (8\xa0km) back to the Danaher farm. There, Sean confronts Will and demands the dower-money. When Will refuses, Sean throws Mary Kate back at her brother, declaring ""no fortune, no marriage"" (which is their custom, not his). The ultimatum shocks both Mary Kate and Will, who finally pays the 350 pounds. Sean immediately burns it in the boiler, abetted by Mary Kate, showing that it was not the money but her husband\'s courage and brother\'s respect she wanted all along. She proudly leaves for home, but a humiliated Will takes a swing at Sean, only to be knocked down by his defensive counter-punch. ', ""A donnybrook ensues, then evolves into a long Homeric fistfight between only Sean and Will after they agree to adhere to the Marquess of Queensberry rules – right before Will kicks Sean in the jaw. This much-anticipated brawl attracts more and more spectators as it continues for miles across countryside and village. The fighters finally pause for a drink inside Cohan's Bar, where they begrudgingly admit a mutual respect for one another. As they argue over who will pay for the drinks, Will tosses a brew into Sean's face. Sean in turn ends the fight by hitting Will so hard he falls back, crashes through the bar's front door, and ends up lying unconscious in the street.

Playfair has earlier revealed to Sean that his church will probably be transferring him and Mrs Playfair, both lifelong residents, due to his shrinking congregation.

Though Sixsmith is initially reluctant to write a human interest story, he meets Philomena and decides to investigate her case.', 'In 1951, Philomena became pregnant after having sex with a man she did not know at a county fair, and was sent by her father to Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea in Ireland. After giving birth, she was forced to work in the convent laundry for four years, with little contact with her son. The nuns gave her son up for adoption without giving Philomena a chance to say goodbye. She kept her lost son a secret from her family for nearly fifty years.', 'Martin and Philomena begin their search at the convent. The nuns claim that the adoption records were destroyed in a fire years earlier; they did not, however, lose the contract she was forced to sign decades ago forbidding her from contacting her son, which Martin considers suspicious. At a pub, the locals tell Martin that the convent burnt the records deliberately, and that most of the children were sold for £1,000 each to wealthy Americans.', ""Martin's investigation reaches a dead end in Ireland, but he receives a promising lead from the United States and invites Philomena to accompany him there. His contacts help him discover that Anthony was renamed Michael A. Hess, who became a lawyer and senior official in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations. When Philomena notices Martin in the background of a photo of Michael, he remembers that he met him years earlier while working in the US. They also learn that he has been dead for eight years."", ""Philomena decides she wants to meet people who knew Michael and learn more about him from them. They visit a former colleague of Michael's and discover that Michael was gay and died of AIDS. They also visit his sister Mary, who was adopted at the same time from the convent, and learn that they were both emotionally and physically abused by their adoptive parents, and hear about his partner Pete Olsson."", ""After avoiding Martin's attempts to contact him, Pete agrees to talk to Philomena. He shows Philomena some videos of his life with Michael. To Martin and Philomena's surprise, they see footage of Michael, dated shortly before he died, at the Abbey where he was adopted, and Pete explains that, although he never told his family, Michael had privately wondered about his birth mother all his life, and had returned to Ireland in his final months to try to find her. Pete informs them that the nuns had told Michael that his mother had abandoned him and that they had lost contact with her. He also reveals that, against his parents' wishes, he had Michael buried in the convent's cemetery."", ""Philomena and Martin go to the convent to ask them where Michael's grave is. Despite Philomena's efforts to stop him, Martin angrily breaks into the private quarters and argues with an elderly nun, Sister Hildegarde McNulty, who worked at the convent when Anthony was forcibly adopted. He accuses her of lying to a dying man and denying him the chance to finally reunite with his mother, purely out of self-righteousness. Hildegarde is unrepentant, saying that losing her son was Philomena's penance for having sex out of wedlock."", ""Martin demands an apology, telling her that what she did was un-Christian, but is speechless when Philomena instead chooses to forgive her of her own volition. Philomena then asks to see her son's grave, where Martin tells her he has chosen not to publish the story.

Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her.', ""Elliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah's sisters, Lee, and eventually begins an affair with her.  Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength.  Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick, who is much older.  She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her.  She leaves Frederick after admitting to having an affair with somebody.  For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Elliot's inability to end his marriage to Hannah.  Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else."", ""Hannah's ex-husband Mickey, a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story.  Flashbacks reveal that his marriage to Hannah fell apart after they were unable to have children because of his infertility.  However, they had twins who are not biologically his, before divorcing.  He also went on a disastrous date with Hannah's sister Holly, when they were set up after the divorce.  A hypochondriac, he goes to his doctor complaining of hearing loss, and is frightened by the possibility that it might be a brain tumor.  When tests prove that he is perfectly healthy, he is initially overjoyed, but then despairs that his life is meaningless.  His existential crisis leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion to Catholicism and an interest in Krishna Consciousness.  Ultimately, a suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup in a movie theater.  The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love."", ""Holly's story is the film's third main arc.  A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career.  After borrowing money from Hannah, she starts a catering business with April, a friend and fellow actress.  Holly and April end up as rivals in auditions for parts in Broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect, David.  Holly abandons the catering business after the romance with David fails and decides to try her hand at writing.  The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents.  She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah.  It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Elliot's marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee (having been transmitted first from Elliot).  Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details.  Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date."", ""A minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma and Evan.  They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own.  Their own tumultuous marriage revolves around Norma's alcoholism and alleged affairs, but the long-term bond between them is evident in Evan's flirtatious anecdotes about Norma while playing piano at the Thanksgiving gatherings."", ""By the time of the film's third Thanksgiving, Lee has married someone she met while taking classes at Columbia University, while Hannah and Elliot have reconciled their marriage.

Drummond grows frustrated, feeling the case has already been decided. When he asks to withdraw from the case, the judge holds Drummond in contempt of court, orders him jailed, and tells Drummond to show cause the next morning why he should not be held in contempt of court. John Stebbins offers his farm as collateral for Drummond's bail. Stebbins' son was a friend and protégé of Cates who drowned after developing a cramp while swimming. Brown had said the child was damned to hell because he was not baptized.

Drummond hammers home his point —  that Cates, like any other man, demands the right to think for himself, and those citing divine support as a rationale to silence him are wrong."", 'The jury finds Cates guilty, but, the judge, concerned with political embarrassment, fines him only $100 ($1,476 in current dollars).

Hunsecker will then gain points with Susan by defending Dallas and getting his job back, with Falco counting on an overly prideful Dallas rejecting a tainted favor.', 'To get his dirt planted, Falco plans to blackmail a prominent columnist by threatening to expose his marital infidelity. Instead, the columnist chooses exposure over his journalistic integrity - which even his wife praises as his ""first decent act in years"". Falco then bribes a second columnist with a sexual favor to be provided by a cigarette girl he has a friendly relationship with, misleading her into waiting for him in his bedroom only to arrive with the columnist - a new low, even for Falco.

Unable to talk himself out of what seems like a trap, Falco is brutally slapped around by Hunsecker. Livid, Falco reveals to Susan that her brother conspired to frame Dallas.

Four young women – Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) – are forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene asylum.The film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates, portraying their harsh daily regimen and their squalid living conditions at the laundries.', 'Each woman suffers horrific cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior. Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour, is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when she mockingly laughs at Una as she hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks.', 'Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to Mary Magdalene, who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a ""contest"" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina. However, as the years pass, automatic washing machines start to appear, a modern household appliance whose growing ubiquity would eventually fatally undermine the economic viability of commercial laundries and make the Magdalene asylums unsustainable.', ""Three of the girls are shown, to some extent, to triumph over their situation and their captors.

The Mother Superior is so surprised, she only moves past her after the Bishop tells her to come along.

The two girls escape her clutches and are helped to return to the real world by a sympathetic relative, their story optimistically ending when Rose boards a coach bound for the ferry to Liverpool and Bernadette becomes an apprentice hairdresser. Crispina's end, however, is not a happy one; she spends the rest of her days in a mental institution (where she was sent to silence her from revealing the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Father Fitzroy) and dies of anorexia at age 24.[6] The film's script is fictional, but based on four testimonies reported in the documentary Sex in a Cold Climate.
