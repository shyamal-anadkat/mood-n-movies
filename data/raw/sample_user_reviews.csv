"['i just saw the fanedit of this by spicediver, available on youtube.  It was amazing, like Lawrence of Arabia with worms.', 'Dune has clumsy special effects and fight scenes, some motivations are questionable but Lynch shows his versatility, his surreal trademark is latent and story is at least interesting.', ""This film is for me one of the best science fiction films. I like this atmosphere on the border of the strange. The Midle Eastern inspired sets add a touch of originality and strangeness to this film. The actors are equiped with the necessary thickness for this great intergalactic epic. It doesn't matter that this film doesn't not fully conform to Franck Herbert's story (I have not read). For me, David Lynch made a really great movie, which have not to be ashamed in front of Star Wars or Blade runner."", 'Perhaps we will never know if this version (1984) could have the same strengths as the current version (2021) were it not for the fact that director David Lynch - it was not his fault - worked on commission, with a gag and few creative freedoms. The result is a sterile monster that lacks a face and a brain, and pretended to be identical to Star Wars. No wonder the memory still gives Mr. Lynch spasms of shame.', 'Depth: 2/2Importance: 2/2Relevance: 2/2Artistry: 2/2Imagination: 2/2Total: 10/10', ""Fascinating yet messy storytelling with more exposition than action and some bizarre costume and visual effects concepts that push the boundaries of what was possible in 1984. Seems a bit of a missed opportunity as if they had dialled it back a notch this could've found commercial success rather than its niche cult slot. Very entertaining for fans of sci fi fantasy movies."", 'While it has strangely some appeal it is a below average movie and an awful adaption. There are some questionable production choices and the director had to force the whole story into one movie while also being denied of creative freedom. Lets start with the compression of the story. If you did not have seen the book it is pretty thick and some will claim it would stop a bullet ;-). It is almost like wanting to make The Lord of the Rings into two or even one extra long movie. The characters are also compressed into baseline forms or outright changed. Then there is the awkward choice to display inner monologues or though with voices while zooming in on the characters faces. It is irritating, awkward and makes you think WTF did they think or what did I just see. There are also questionable character designs that could fit into horror movies and destroyed the immersion. I will not hit on the special effects. Some look really good for its time but there are also exceptions. The actors deliver a decent to good job but are limited or sometimes even destroyed by the script and decisions. I think the term “Development Hell” or “Destined to Fail” are good descriptions. With the great cast it is a pity because I think that there is not one weak actor in the movie. I will not describe what was changed because there are countless rants or videos on the internet and it would be to much to list here in 5000 words. Remark: I even found a list on Wikipedia (Strangely only in the German article). Fans of the book will be up in arms to rip this movie a new one. The story has of cause a lot of plot holes and the compression of the story leaves you often wondering why, how or what happened. However I must admit that it has a strange appeal to me. The overall story, lore and world building makes me want to see more of the world and read trough all books of the saga. The concepts and ideas are brilliant but much is not explained. For example: Do you know what makes Paul even special? Overall this is even a good attempt given the limitations. While it is defiantly neither a good adaptation nor movie I respect what they did.', ""Dune is arguably one of the worst written films of all time. It was the equivalent of trying to cram the Lord of the Rings into 2 films rather than 3. There was just too much going on to warrant this being a single movie when it should have been broken up into two. Or they should have trimmed the story to focus more on certain characters over others.Either way, It's still a nightmare of a script with way too many awful looking special effects and makeup designs that just don't work."", 'Don\'t be fooled by the cult classic status. On the whole this is obviously not a good movie.    I\'ve just finished the novel, which I enjoyed. Frank Herbert built a fascinating and convincing world and, as any great author, understood the importance and art of gradually setting up points of interest and later resolving them. The screenplay here does the opposite, and starts by narrating a ham-fisted and pointless information dump. One illustrative example: the Spacing Guild. In the novel they are a secretive organisation whose involvement and motivations slowly unfold throughout the story. And the Guild members themselves, rumoured to have strayed from human form, are never seen; they only do business by means of human agents. They are glimpsed only once, through a vision of Paul\'s, and he does not disclose what he saw. This is effective, engaging storytelling. In this movie, within the first ten minutes, a Guild member is placed directly before the Emperor. (Oh yes, you also immediately see the Emperor and are told his motives.) The Guild member is a big scary monster. Whoo. It then tells the Emperor that the Guild are in charge and that the Emperor must kill Paul Atreides because he\'s going to destroy the spice, which is essential to the Guild. Okay then. This kind of boneheaded obviousness is all over, and as a result the story is flat and boring. At several points it\'s downright cringe-inducing. ""I\'m going to miss Caladan so much!"", Lady Jessica shouts at Duke Leto, as they prepare to leave their homeworld. Great, thanks for explaining.    Most of the performances are bad, due to the bad writing, bad casting, and plain bad acting. Sometimes it\'s difficult to watch. Kyle MacLachlan does his best as Paul but is miscast and too old. Sting actually provides the best performance here as Feyd-Rautha -- take from that what you will. Baron Harkonnen is written ridiculously but Kenneth McMillan just about pulls it off.    Many characters are changed for the worse. The Lady Jesscia is an excellent female character in the book -- strong, cunning, magical. In the film she is useless and sometimes hysterical, serving only as mother to Paul. Other female characters receive similarly poor treatment. There appears to be only a single woman amongst the Fremen, and her only role is as Paul\'s lover. Also rather baffling is that every character is white. The cosmopolitanism of Frank Herbert\'s novel was an essential ingredient, drawing from many cultures, religions and races, so this is a real disservice to the source material. Dr Yueh should obviously be of asian descent. Thufir Hawat is described as ""dark skinned"" -- in the film he looks like he should be wearing a smoking jacket and holding a glass of port. Fremen culture is clearly derived from the Middle East, and they\'ve lived for thousands of years in a scorching desert! In the film they don\'t even have a tan.    Visually the film is a mixed bag. Some of the sets and costumes are good. Some are bad. There are a few interesting abstract sequences. The design of the worms is pretty good. But the execution of the special effects ranges from okay to bad. This was released seven years after Star Wars; it looks much worse. Most of the score is by Toto for some reason, and it gets pretty bad when the electric guitars start playing. There\'s one track written by Brian Eno which is an absolute stand out and sounds just how the book felt. If only the rest of the film were as successful.', ""I don't know what happened to Lynch when he directed this movie. This is full of **** I somehow completed watching this movie. I would rather kill myself than watch this movie again.""]",dune,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dune/user-reviews?sort-by=most-helpful&num_items=50,10
"['Ghostbusters is surprising in how well it works. From embracing the bizarre premise of guys capturing ghosts, to creating a menace that’s both threatening and laughable at the same time, and most importantly creating a team to care about. Varrick, Egon, and Ray only capture one ghosts and beat another the rest is montaging but the time spent with them makes it easily to over.   The result is a fun summer blockbuster that for some emotionally connects burns with nostalgia resulting in a film that his highly recommended.', ""[ Written on April 3rd, 2016 ] Back in 1984, this movie was the huge success of fame and money. It also showed us how great it were to see 4 great men bustin' some ghosts. A lot of fun (yes, a lot of that fun) will instantly come to you making you imagining that you're on the adventure. Who isn't afraid of any ghost? Me. Who are you going to call? Me... for these reviews. If you still have a copy of this home, go watch it all day instead."", ""This is a great movie! If you hate Ghostsbusters, you're silly as JB. The storyline is good. The ghosts look okay. The intro song is what I like. Ghostsbusters is a great movie and I recommend you watch it. Haven't seen it in AGES though..."", 'This films best moments are in the witty interactions and dialogue between the cast. Its a comedy action film which is a perfect tone for the films story. The story is certainly sloppy and mostly forgettable but the writing and humor and fun action moments and entertaining set-pieces are really what made this film a classic. Highly Recommended.', 'A hilariously funny comedy with many classic and laugh out loud moments. Especially those coming from Bill Murray who gave a legendary comedic performance. I would recommend this movie to all comedy lovers. 10/10 (Legendary)', 'This movie was awesome. I just watched it and enjoyed it. The storyline was good. Bill Murray did a great job acting in it. The special effects were cool. The characters were good. Ghostbusters is one of the best films of the 1980s and it is definitely worth watching. P.S. Ghostbusters >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Justin Bieber.', 'I have never had the fortune of watching Ghostbuster all the way through until now. I have probably seen the film entirely in bits and pieces but it is so much more remarkable all together. This film may be the best blockbuster film of all time and it holds up pretty well after 30 years and it can still be enjoyed by the next generation of film watchers. Ghostbusters is original and it is one of the few sci-fi comedies that ever worked. There are lots of good gags here and the characters are so loveable. Bill Murray was at the peak of his sarcastic powers for this movie and the same goes for Dan Aykroyd. The film is a great visual and there are so many blockbusters out there that try to be Ghostbusters and fail.', 'This is one of the funniest, scariest horror comedy ever! I love the characters, the special effects still hold up great, a really fast moving plot, It was glorious!', 'There are just a hand full of movies I revisit on a yearly basis and Ghostbusters are right at the top there is a reason why this movie keeps on living in the hearts of millions while 99% of all other movies lose their steam within a year of their release. For the 30th Anniversary I give this movie a 10 out of 10 score', 'Jokes are hit and miss and the film has dated badly. Its less clever and more dumb.']",ghostbusters,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/ghostbusters/user-reviews?sort-by=most-helpful&num_items=50,10
"['Titanic is the movie which really made me respect James Cameron as a film maker. He had made excellent movies before such as Terminator 1 and 2, True Lies, and Aliens, but Titanic is really different. Here he offers excellent and believable characters, stunning visuals and a compelling story. This movie is truly a 10!', 'I can\'t believe some people don\'t like this film. It is timeless, I have seen it at least 15 times and would gladly watch it another 30 (I probably will). One of the rare movies that can make me cry every time. However, it is not the ""I\'ll never let go"" part that sets me off...it\'s the old people cuddling in bed and the mother reading one last story to her children..because you know then that they have lost all hope. Truly beautiful.', ""to all you people who claim its bad, only because you dont like romance or that it wasn't actiony enough for you: dont comment on how good a movie it is if you cant stand apart from personal opinion. its a damn good movie and even if you don't like romance or epic 11 TIME OSCAR WINNERS -may i point out-you have to admit its amazing. i love it and will always love it."", 'This is by far the best movie ever made! he acting is amazing and the effects are perfect and the score is lifealtering. you will cry your heart out! the movie will change your life. after seeing it, i was numb and cried every time someone even mentioned titanic....... and i am a 14 year old boy! best movie ever!', ""This is the best movie ever. Those who say that it's horrible, are just people without feelings. If you are sentimental, you love love stories, you will definetily will love this movie. Kate ands Leonardo are just great. The whole movie is great. The best of all times."", 'Beautiful movie....\r This movie is the greatest in Romantic genre.\r Perfect movie by James Cameroon.\r Perfect acting by  Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet', 'This movie was a good makeing. It really explains true love. But it also makes you think twice before getting on a ship or a boat in the icey waters.', ""Titanic has stunning visual effects and wonderful acting from the versatile cast. Dicaprio, Winslet, Zane and\rBates give brilliant performances. The movie has action, drama, romance, and suspense. There's nothing\rmore that a filmgoer could ask for."", 'Unbelievable movie. I think everybody should go back to when he first watched this movie and no judge after watching it several times . Great love story that cannot be repeated in any other movie!', ""The main reason everybody likes this movie is because of the last 30 minutes where the boat sinks, it's awesome but that means the rest of the movie is irrelevant. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are a terrible couple and the only chemistry is between the ship and the iceberg.""]",titanic,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/titanic/user-reviews?sort-by=most-helpful&num_items=50,10
