Here's where we are housing all the scripts:

* `imdb_scraper.py` : this is the script that we're using to scrape the data for top 1000 movies on IMDB. 
* `metacritic_scraper.py`: this is the script we're using to scrape user/critic from Metacritic. 

### Why Metacritic? 

Metacritic offers the most balanced aggregate score. If you don't mind which critics' opinions go into the final score and prefer seeing a general average, then you should use Metacritic. Its standards are mostly unknown, but Metacritic makes it easy to compare professional and user reviews side-by-side.
